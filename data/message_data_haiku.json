you for today thank you for your word God we pray that you would just teach us challenge us and change us and we pray this in jesus' name we all say that was weak we all say Amen hey the baptism candidates are you guys ready this is going to be so fun here in a minute I'm proud PR of you guys so many of you guys we've been in this message series called do something radical and last week we looked at using your influence for God last week we dug into the idea of every one of us has influence that everything in life we've ever been given has come directly from God so we looked at influence we looked at hey how do we maximize the influence God has given us to populate heaven to make the world a better place today we're looking at something similar and that is the power of affluence we're looking at using your affluence for God last week we talked about everything in life is a gift your life is a gift abilities your relationships your families your backgrounds childhoods experiences networks finances everything is a gift a gift from God and with every gift Comes This responsibility of managing that gift well and so today we're going to look at the gift of affluence and as we do I want to define the word affluence to you as we get going the word affluence is defined as having a great deal of money or wealth let's read that out loud together it is the state of having a great deal of money or wealth let's try it again that was a little sleepy for the afternoon service affluence is the state of having a great deal of money or wealth touch your neighbor and say this sermon is definitely for you because you're rich come on tell somebody you are rich you are rich I know some of you you know you checked out as soon as I said affluent you know I said affluence and you said oh man this one's not for me I'm coming back next week but I'd like to remind you that you are rich and you are wealthy and with the riches and wealth comes a responsibility and maybe you're still confused like man I'm not rich well you are rich because the truth is if you live in the United States of America you are rich you are wealthy in fact 80% this is mindblowing 80% eight out of every 10 people 80% of humanity lives on less than $10 a day we are Rich we are wealthy almost 1 billion people in the world live on less than $2 a day we are rich we are wealthy and the Bible says to whom much is given what does it say much is required we are rich we are wealthy we are very very wealthy as a matter of fact I don't know if you've ever gone on a missions trip to a third world country but if you haven't we'd like to invite you to go with us on one of our trips we do trips all year round we go to places like Nicaragua we go to Mexico City we go to Haiti we go to Africa we go all around into third world countries and we do ministry in fact one of the specific things that we do in Nicaragua is we go down there and we build houses has anybody gone to Nicaragua with us anybody in this service a few of you if you've not gone I think you should make that your mission over the next 12 months and say I'm going on Mission with Impact Church to Nicaragua here's why because it will change you it will change your life we go down there and we build new houses for villagers when I mean new houses I mean we build houses that you and I would never live in but they are going crazy over them a house a house for us to build in Nicaragua it only cost $150000 $1,500 you could buy a house right now for $1,500 and we've been doing this for the last 14 years and we're going to continue to do it fly in and we get to work and we build houses $1,500 you think man what can you buy well what do they have now if $1,500 is an upgrade well here's a picture of something that this is a real live picture of a house before we built the house their walls are bed sheets this is how people listen to me they live today this next picture it's a picture of another one of their houses and and can you go back please where's the other one that one that is a family's house so we make it our mission to build them a new house so this next picture it's one of the houses that we built and it is a firm foundation it's still nothing you and I would live in today in this nation you would never live in a $1,500 house but you'd think that they hit the lottery we build these houses and they get so excited that many times they want us to carve the word Impacto into the foundation and Mamas are crying because they're so grateful and they're so thankful what am I saying I'm saying that we are rich in the United States of America we are a fluent and with much comes much responsibility even the homeless person in the United States is Rich even the homeless person because the homeless person in the United States doesn't have to think about am I going to get a glass of clean drinking water today see in a third world country and many of the countries that I've been in and steep foot in and ministered to I have I have seen with my own eyes mamas carrying Jerry cans for four or 6 hours walking to find water and then getting water and bringing it back to their families but the waters contaminated we are rich we are wealthy we are rich and we are wealthy we have influence but we also have affluence and God wants us to use it for his kingdom and for his glory with all the money the wealth the affluence comes responsibility I said this last week we have a spiritual responsibility and that is our response to God's abilities our response to God's given abilities he gives us so much how do we respond so today the outline is really three questions that I want us to ask ourselves three questions today that I challenge you to ask yourself and to answer it honestly question number one if you're ready Touch Somebody and tell them I'm ready I'm ready touch somebody else tell them I'm ready y'all are getting quiet on me somebody say I'm ready come on somebody shout I'm ready question number one is can God trust me say it out loud can God trust me I'm not talking about me I'm talking about you can God trust you can he trust you because I think we all go oh yeah God can trust me but can he really trust you Jesus talked specifically about trust in Luke 16 he teaches a parable that is known as the parable of the good Steward or the par of the shrewd manager and this is what he says he says whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with very much whoever can be trusted with a little they can be trusted with a lot but whoever is dishonest with a little will also be dishonest with much so if you've not been trustworthy and handling worldly wealth who will trust you with true riches and if you've not been trustworthy with someone else's property who will give you property of your own no one can serve two masters either you will hate the one and love the other or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other let's read this last part out loud together you cannot serve both God and money so he's saying listen there's this trust Factor can I can I trust you trust it begins in small increments can I trust you with a little bit that's the way relationships are can I trust you and we give a little bit then we go okay I can give a little bit more if I were to let you borrow my car today he said PT can I borrow your car I said yes sure man here here's the keys and if you brought the car back dirty if you brought the car back and it had less gas than when you took it if you brought the car back and it had some you know some wheel rash and it had it wasn't taken care of I wouldn't trust you the next time around so God is saying can I trust you and it is proven in the little before you're ever given a lot I think it's interesting that he says he says someone else's property if you've not been trustworthy with someone one else's property and the reason I think that's interesting is because everything is God's Property everything is God's Property everything the Bible says in Psalm 24:1 it says the Earth is the Lord's and everything in it the world and all who live in it right so can he trust us with everything in it whoever can be trusted with little can be trusted with much and then he says he says that you cannot serve two masters right in other words he's saying you're going to have to pick one you can't chase both God and money you can't serve both God and money you've got to pick one which one is your god today so when I think about affluence I think about this scripture in first Timothy chapter 6 this is a good one he says teach those who are rich in this world not to be proud and not to put their trust in money which is so unreliable they their trust should be and God who richly gives us all we need for our enjoyment tell them to use their money to do good they should be rich in good works and generous to those in need always be ready to share with others by doing this they will be storing up their treasure as a good foundation for the future so that they may experience true life see th this passage is to me it's very convicting because it says teach those who are rich so God's telling me Travis Hearn teach those who are rich we are all rich we have defined that we are all wealthy he says teach them and then he outlined seven things in this passage he says teach them not to be proud teach them not to put their trust in Money teach them to put their trust in God teach them to use their money to do good teach them to be uh generous and good with those in need teach them to be ready to share and then he says this is how you store up real treasure this is how you store up real treasure see true living comes from giving when you realize that life will begin to make a lot of sense true living comes from giving so he says teach them to do good works with what I need your help with what I need your help what with what we we we just we just we just freaking read it I mean I just read it like I literally just do I need to put the pod him down on the floor and come at you guys like I just I just look at I'm coming down the floor can you help me I'm coming down the floor I'm going to preach on the floor for the first time in a long time Pastor Whitney give a round of applause I'm G preach on the floor I got to make sure that wait I got to preach way out here I'm G pre I don't even care I'm dark on the screen that's okay y'all can figure it out now this is y'all didn't know I was so short did you you guys look so good I'm proud of you guys I I'm proud of you guys I really am you guys should be proud of yourselves this is New Life fist bump one 2 three yes let's go let's go I I just want everybody man if I could get this inside of your spirits to where you really believe what I'm doing to where you actually put it to work it will be lifechanging are you recording me can I record myself can you just hit record yeah yeah is it recording I now I'm recording all you guys this is cool look at all the baptism candidates let's go Impact Church they're everywhere I don't know whose phone this is but let's go here we go it's not this is what I'm talking about is I was going to preach the rest of the sermon holding this is it on me is it on me okay all right so so this is what I this is what I love this is what I love about this this is what I love about the third service cuz PT goes off the rails and I got to behave the first two services but I don't have to for the third service I I wanted you to understand I wanted you to understand what it said cuz it said teach them to do good works but it's saying because I kept saying with what with what with their money cuz cuz cuz that's the part teach them to to do good works with their money their money be be because when it comes to when it comes to church you know what it is I don't know what it is but you might know when it comes to church and money we all get funny about money you know what I'm saying I almost titled today's message funny money because we only get funny about money when it comes to church yeah we do cuz we're not funny about money with the coffees that we buy every day that are overpriced we're not funny about that kind of money we're not funny about overspending in our life we're not funny about living outside of our means in life we're not funny about overpaying for a car in life we're not funny about paying overpaying for an interest rate we're not funny about buying a house that we can't afford we're not funny about money in any other area in life than when it comes to giving to God how many with me okay on your phone back bro you are jacked that just happen this genetics born and raised jacked is your name Jack oh no it's David that's okay David jacked funny money funny money and I was thinking how do I make money not be funny in church and the problem is there's two reasons money's funny here's the two number one is because we don't trust God yeah our faith is more in our money than it is in our Master we don't trust God the second reason and this is about as real as I can get is we don't trust churches right yeah your your your oo was louder on that one than it was the first one and I feel that like we're funny about money because we don't trust God but we also don't like man you know like you know because people that have gone before us churches spiritual leaders have done funny things with money things right and so we go I don't know but here's what I want to encourage you you ever heard the saying don't throw the baby out with the bath water okay don't let a human derail the way you're supposed to live your life according to God's word just because maybe somebody else didn't and here's what I want to say if you don't don't trust your church or your church leaders or your pastors I feel that but this is what I would say find one where you do and go all in for Jesus Christ find a church that you believe in and go man I believe in the mission I believe in what they're doing and so I'm going to go all in for Jesus Christ I I I think about the church in America and it fires me up because I can preach passionately about anything I can preach with an organ I can preach with some hype I can say God's going to get you through I could say oh I got a story for you I could say David faced that giant you know what David killed that giant with and y' all like a slingshot a stone and I'm going to say no he didn't kill the giant with a slingshot and a stone David he knocked the giant down with the sling Shaw and his Stone but David walked over and he took the sword out of that Giant's belt and he pulled that sword out and he chopped the Giant's head off what am I trying to say I'm trying to say that David took what the enemy meant for him and he took it and he stole it and he used it against the enemy and I don't know about you but in my life I'm taking that enemy sword and I pulled it out and it's taken me a while but that sword's in the air and devil you better get ready because the sword's on its way down the sword's on its way down and so I can preach passionately about how God's going to do it and God's going to get you through and we need to take back what the enemy stole and the devil's a liar and God's going to heal you and God's going to wreck you and God's but when I talk about money I better not be too loud and crazy I I I bet I better not get too I better not make you feel too convicted cuz we all funny about money we're all funny about money and the and the thing is I think of the church in America and I think of this passage in Revelation 3 you tell me you tell me because this is what I think I think this passage defines the Church of the United States of America so here's what it says I know your Deeds I know that you're neither hot or cold I wish you were one or the other so because you're lukewarm neither hot or cold I'm about to spit you out of my mouth he saying you you you you the church in America which by the way is also our church it's our church too that's us we're the church he goes you're not hot you're not cold you make me sick I'd rather you get hot I'd rather you get cold I'd rather you get off the fence I'd rather you stop living with one foot in the word and one foot in the world like man you're making me sick like man and then and then he goes on a little further and he goes you say I am rich I've acquired wealth and I don't need a thing but you don't realize that you're wretched pitiful poor blind and naked tell me that is not the Church of the United States of America because money gets in the way of our Master is money in the way of your master see this is why I've dedicated my life to building the church I've dedicated my life to building the church I've given my life for the church this is why the call of God is on my life this is why I'm passionate about building the church this is why I'm passionate about preaching about Jesus Christ This Is Why I'm passionate about preaching unapologetically the truth of the Holy scriptures this is why we did this campaign in 2024 and we continue and do something radical man if I had 20% of my church that would do something radical for Jesus Christ we would change the world just 20% of my church this is why we said we want to raise $8 million cash to buy South Scottdale to pay for it cash to renovate it and by the way y'all we've already raised over $5 million cash and we bought the building in cash two Thursdays ago this is why we continue and we say we're going to spend the rest of the year 24 we're going to raise the other three million this is why we say on December 29th the last Sunday of the year we're GNA finish strong and we're going to give a miracal offering and we're going to sew a seed and we're going to come together we're going to pay for this thing cash because we have an opportunity to leave a legacy and to build God's church question number one question number one is can God trust me question number two is this will I sacrifice and help build God's church will I sacrifice somebody say the word sacrifice sacrifice come on say it again sacrifice will I sacrifice I'm not talking about tipping God I'm not talking about tipping God God you tip the waitress you tip the waiter you tip everybody nowadays I can't even walk outside I got to tip the mailman I got to tip everybody man everybody tip tip tip tip and then we come to God and study show statistics show Church statistics show that the church in the United States of America that the church consist of 20% of their congregations that actually give you know what that means 80% doesn't even tip God you know what that means it means that we live in a culture in 2024 that the church is a culture of consumer Christians what's consumer Christians it's what do you have for me today God God will you bless me God I want your favor God will you heal me God will you fix my depression God will you heal my heart God will you heal my marriage God will you open this door God will you give me a promotion God will you me me me me me me me me and then every worship song that we sing is about what God's going to do for us so good is this too hard for you is consumer Christianity that's what the church is filled with I'mma come get mine takers Pastor darrison comes out we gonna give to God well I mean I'm not I'm G to sit here and eat my free donut drink my free coffee I mean that butter finger ain't no joke that Butterfinger coffee like come on man Lord but I'm not I mean I'm not going to give anything to I'm not going to serve in the church I'm not going you going ask me to actually do something you going ask me to do like do you're going to ask consumerism consumer Christians that's not biblical this not biblical do you know what is biblical cross bearing Christians Christians that take up their crosses that will go to their death for their savior I I I'm asking to sacrifice by the way a sacrifice means it hurts a tip does not hurt a sacrifice is like dude that hurts so I'm asking our church today to ask yourselves today will you sacrifice to help build God's Church see sacrifice means that you give it I think it's crazy that in 2024 that doing something radical would be building God's church I mean that's crazy isn't that a crazy idea I mean we're going to build God's Church in 20 I mean what everybody else is busy building all kinds of weird freaking things I mean the the world is relentless on building things right I mean we're building these weird cultures my daughter was telling me this my daughter she's 15 she was like Dad did you know that we've got some furries in our school I'm like you got a what what's that oh it's people who identify as animals what yeah they walk around meowing and barking and then we've got a whole culture of people going yeah people can be whatever they want to be you're a human you're you're a human being God created you as a human being you are created as a human being you are created the way God created you to be let me say it again you were created to be exactly how God created you to be God did not make a mistake he did not make a mistake you are created to be the exact person that you were born to be and man we spend all this time and all this money and all this energy building these weird things in the world and I'm asking you to help me build the Church of God how dare I in 2024 man how dare I asking my church to sacrifice you guys know David in the Bible you know the stories about David give me some things what do you think of when you think of David courage what do you think of when you think of David Shepherd what else I need somebody on this side okay a man after God's Own Heart good a psalmist what else David slayed the Giant right David committed adultery yeah yeah David David David David David we know so many stories about David let me tell you something that maybe you don't know about David do you know that David was the greatest church building fundraiser in the history of humanity yeah they went and built the temple David spearheaded that they raised $400 million in a one-time cash offering 400 million in those times but this is what I love most about the story of David and Solomon building the Temple there's this one verse that really sums it up he says in 1 chonicles 21: 24 he says I will not sacrifice that which costs me no nothing I don't know I'm fired up but I'm really proud of our church because we already raised $5.5 million cash and we're going to raise the next 3 million over the next few months if you haven't been able to get in on this and you want to get on in on this it's called our radical Faith campaign and there's actually these envelopes in the seat pockets in front of you I'd love if you'd take one of those and pray about it and take it home with you and ask God God how much would you like me to give to help build the church please don't feel obligated because God hasn't needed you before and he still doesn't actually need you I I you know another preacher talking about money well well I I I got a I got a question I got a question first of all Pastor Whitney I'm not just another preacher come on who said that I have a question would you guys like a church that was a church that preached the Bible yes or no would you like a pastor let's just use for example Travis Hearn to preach like Travis or preach more like Jesus which one g g Jesus right Jesus don't worry I won't get my feelings hurt Jesus right well I'm glad you said that because as you study the teachings of Jesus he taught more on money and POS possessions than any other topic and it's not even close Jesus taught more on the subject of money and possessions then he talked about on Heaven or Hell Or Love or forgiveness or any other topic so since you said you want me to teach more like Jesus you said it I didn't say it you said it I've decided to change my strategy and 40 of the 52 calendar weeks of the year I'm going to talk about money no I'm not I'm just kidding but isn't it fascinating it's almost like Jesus knew we'd need some help with this it's almost like he knew that we would need help with how to Steward with a holy reverence and responsibility what's actually his yeah yeah that like in the US we don't even save money we're like the worst country in the world we don't save money let alone give God any we don't save we live outside of our means we spend more than we make we live in debt we're not generous we don't give to others cuz we're living so tight we're self-absorbed we're we're we're selfless selfish in nature so God knew Jesus knew hey y'all going to need some help with this so he taught about money more than any other topic 2third of his teachings were on money and in fact here's one right here I think this is also modern day us OFA he says in Luke chapter 12 he said there's the ground of a certain rich man the ground of a certain American right it it yielded an abundant Harvest oh man dude God is good I am making money on money on money on money this year I've got so much Harvest Whitney I don't know what to do with it it's just coming out every where and then he goes oh I got an idea since I have no place to store my crops I have this idea this is what I'll do Verse 18 I'll tear down my Barns and I'll build bigger barns that's where I'll store my Surplus grain and then I'll say to myself you have plenty of grain laid up for many years take life easy eat drink and be Mary but God told him you fool this very night your life will be demanded from you then who will get all that you prepared for yourself verse 21 this is how it be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God I want us to read verse 21 out loud together ready here we go this is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God what it's I hope I have time for this CU you know it's the service hasn't even been one hour yet and I've seen five or six people leave the building but it's just because they're funny about money but I really want to dig into this okay we are Luke chap 12 stockpiling and stockpiling and stockpiling and you know what I'm going to just get a now I I I going to buy a bigger house now I'm going to buy a better house now I'm going to buy a more expensive house now I'm going to buy another house now I'm going to buy a second house now I'm going to buy a third house now I'm going to buy a winter house and I got a summer house and I got a vacation house and we're just going to stockpile and we're just going to stockpile and now I got a car now I get a better car a more expensive stockpile please hear me out please please please please don't misunderstand me I don't believe having stuff is unbiblical I think you can have a second house third house fourth house fifth house 28 house I think you can I think the secret sauce of this verse is the last phrase you store up things for yourselves but you're not rich towards God so the question is are you rich towards God are you rich toward God so number one is can I be trusted number two is will I sacrifice and help build God's Church number three come on we're going to land this plain today number three is will I put God first will I put God first will you say it out loud with me come on will I put God first that's a big one because I said a minute ago I'm not asking you to tip God the word of God does not ask you to tip God but to give sacrificially the Bible does not teach us or commit command us to give God our leftovers but to give our first fruits first fruits it says in Proverbs 3:9 and 10 honor the Lord with your wealth with the first fruits of your crops what's the first word in the verse say it out Loudon honor come on say it again honor some of you aren't saying it we're going to do it until everybody says it it's just one easy word it's literally h o n o r it's five simple letters y'all can do this ready on the count of three we're going to say honor one two three honor that was better but it wasn't perfect so we're going to try it again on the count of three I want you to look at somebody CU now you're going to hold each other accountable this is a little lesson on accountability look at somebody don't look at me look at somebody else look at somebody look him right in the eye let just stare at them uncomfortably for just a minute just awkwardly stare gaze deep into their soul for just no Kissy Kissy no none of that just staring into their eyes and now just just just one time on the count through you the word honor one two [Applause] three I wonder I wonder if how we use our money honors God you know cuz cuz cuz it it it I didn't I mean I'm just telling you I don't know I'm not making it up I'm preaching I'm preaching from the Bible like I I didn't it'd be cool if I made that up that's good stuff man I wish I could take credit for that like I can't I didn't write it I got to live by it and I abide by it but I didn't write it but he says honor the Lord with your wealth with the first fruit what the heck are first fruits you know what I'm saying like dude what the FR even have a crop we talking about honoring God with the first fruits of my CR I don't have a crop do you have a crop I don't have a crop you have a crop you got some wheat in the backyard you know I didn't say weed I said wheat cuz I know some of y'all this the third service you got some weed in the backyard there he said he he said he he says honor the Lord with your first fruits man I hope I don't fall in this tank cuz I I just to sit it for a minute first fruits okay here is it's so simple even a baby can understand it let's pretend I got a banana tree in my backyard I don't and that banana tree produces harvests let's just say 100 bananas like 100 bananas honoring the Lord with the first FR Roots would be the first of my bananas I know it's it's it's super deep right so this this ties us into a Biblical concept called tiing right tiing is a Biblical concept Biblical word okay and it means 10% it mean listen I'm just a messenger I you can shoot me if you want but I didn't write it like I'm just a messenger I have I tithe actually the Bible says don't let your left hand know what your right hand is giving so I I have a a little bit of a i i there's a part of me wants to just put I I just want to put my tithe record up for the last 31 years so y'all can see it because we don't miss we don't miss we don't like we honor God my wife and I we honor God with okay here's why it's here's why first fruits is so important because 10% 10% the the the word tithe means 10th part 10th part 10th part everybody take a deep breath relax I don't care if you for me as an individual human being I don't actually give a you know what if you tie or not I'm not coming and going give me your wallet bro you're going to do it in Jesus like I don't I don't freaking care relax relax you can walk out of here and go that was crazy but we're still not doing it great I don't look at the tithing records I don't even know you anyway like if I'm like oh they don't I don't even know who you are like it's fine you get to live with God and that's your he you're accountable to him not me I don't care so just deep breath and just hear me out you know what I'm saying some of you some of you have been like this the whole service like gosh that's okay keep being a consumer I don't care I don't I a 10th part there there's this scripture it's in it's in Leviticus but it says as is a tenth of all you produ a tenth of all you produce it's the Lord and it's holy that verse messed me up when I was like 20 years old because it says a tenth of all you produces the Lord's it doesn't say it's yours will you give it back to the Lord it says it's actually the Lord's and then it says it's holy and see what we're missing in the United States of America today is Holiness we're missing a reverence from God we're re we're missing an awe of who God is we're we we're like God understands my heart God knows my heart I can live like hell and love God no you can't no you can't yes God is a god of love and grace and mercy he's also a god of judgment and wrath and so then then you're like well why why did God set up I don't know I don't know why the tithe the tithe it's like it's 10 why did God say 10 I don't know it could have been 12 it could have been three could have been 14 could have been like the government 60% you know and some of y'all freaking crazy every four years you lose it and you are more passionate about your political views than your biblical views if I if I you know what I like to do I like to start my own country can we do that and we don't have two political parties we have one nation under God that were citizens of Heaven that we're all citizens of heaven and then we're going to talk more biblically than we're going to talk politically because people get crazy man and they're like oh that's our answer that man that woman they're not the answer he's the answer he's the answer he's the answer it's like oh man I got people are crazy people people hit me with direct message like you going to talk about who to vote for you lost your freaking mind I'll tell you who to Bow before but I'm not I don't care who you vote for you can policy whatever you want to believe in and what that does is I put you in confinement of what you can or cannot do that's policy that's external God penetrates the heart and he changes the internal that's what I'm interested in God doing it we don't need more policy we need the spirit of God to sweep through the nation and we need a Revival in the land we need the spirit and the power of God to penetrate the hearts and the minds and The Souls of men and God we need the spirit of God to convict us to the depths of our soul so that we will fall and repent before [Applause] him political stuff my gosh now would they lie the other person they're trth they're both liars every Pol I'm sorry if you're a politician in my church you're like a car salesman you're a liar okay not not all y'all not all y'all most many okay some I'm feeling bad some why do we do it why do we do it does God need our money he he doesn't need your money for some of you he's never had your money he's doing all right he's he's still doing just fine why why do we do it here's here's why we do it this verse I love this verse Deuteronomy 14:23 it says the purpose there's a purpose what's there's a purpose the purpose of tithing is to teach you to always put God first the purpose of tithing is to teach you to always put God first in your lives that's the purpose wait it teaches me continually wait wait so I so wait it it's not just about what I say could you imagine if it was about what you said I'm just saying about what you just said oh God you're number one I love you you're number one and then you and then you go live like hell all week but he's number one it's like if I'm married and I cheat on my wife and I'm like but I love you babe you do I yeah I do I mean I you know you forgive me you understand you know my heart babe you know you know my heart you know how God I mean you know my heart I'm a man I mean women are hot women are hot by the way I'm a man women women are hot men are not hot I just want to set the record straight my and I got eyes for my wife gosh we're going to get to the baptisms in just a minute you guys picked a great day to be baptized you'll never forget this as long as you shall live Funny Money the purpose is to teach me to put God first so remember last week I said Billy Graham Billy Graham said that your bank statement is a theological statement it shows you who and what you love the most that's a good word yeah so what do you love the most so so what do you love the most I love God like the proof the proof the the the proof is in the tithe he he actually you know the test is the tithe the litmus test of your faith is the tithe sorry I told you you I'm not you don't have to do it walk out of here flip me the double bird I'm good I'm telling you what the words the test is the tithe if you're here and you're not tithing you're not going to hell it's not a heaven or hell issue it's a doing God's work it's a putting God first issue right so he says the test is in the tith this is what he says specifically in Malachi chapter 3 maybe you heard this verse he says bring the whole tithe into the storehouse do you does any word in there stand out to you CU one of those words stands out to me whole it's like God knew we're going to be trying some trickery well God I gave 4% but you know my heart yeah he knows your heart he's not first this is crazy and then he says that there may be enough food in my house test test test me in this I this is crazy test me in this says the Lord Almighty test me in this and see test me and see test me and see this is the only place in scripture God says test me there's only one time in the whole book of of the B 66 books of the Bible that God says test me this is it it's once he says test me and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there won't be enough room to store it test me and see does anybody want to see today you've got to test him to see some of you will never see because you will never test him some of you have never seen seen because you've never tested him and I understand Humanity because I'm human it's hard to believe and I think we usually have good intentions and pour follow through and so here's my final my final thing years ago we created this 90day tithe challenge many of you have already taken this Challenge and I said okay if we're if we're afraid to tithe let's let's make let's let's take baby steps he said let's do a 90-day tithe challeng there's one of these in every seat pocket in front of you I think but the first two Services have taken a lot of them but hopefully there is if not we're going to put a QR code on the screen and you can scan that might even be easier the test me here's what it is and and and and you can leave that up just while I do this segment the test me this here's here's what we did we said try it for 90 days and if after 90 days you're like dude life sucks I went bankrupt 15 times you know God's a fraud it in 90 days I said test God in 90 days test and see and in 90 days if you if you say now then we'll give you your money back think of it as a savings account without without interest we're not giving you interest why would we do that why would we do that because we have tested and we have seen and I want you to be able to see I want you to be able to test God and to see so the question today is is God first place in your life let's pray thank you Lord for your word today God we know that your word can be strong it can be challenging but God I'm thankful that your word always pulls us up and it doesn't pull us down I thank you that your word always strikes a desire to go higher within our souls today listen if you're here today and you've never given your life to Jesus Christ I want you to take a minute right now and with your own lips I want you to pray today God I give you my life I want to make you number one in my life I want you to be my master My Savior My Lord you are my king of all Kings thank you for the cross thank you forgiving me of my sins God I'm forever grateful forever grateful thank you for the gift of eternal life the free gift Lord we love you and we pray this in jesus' name we all say amen amen amen\n</SERMON_TRANSCRIPT>\n<ideal_output>\n{\n    \"summaryText\": \"Wow, what a powerful message delivered in this sermon! In this powerful message about affluence and stewardship, Pastor Travis Hearn (PT) delivers a convicting yet encouraging sermon about our relationship with money. You know how we sometimes get uncomfortable when churches talk about money? PT addresses this head-on, reminding us that Jesus actually taught more about money than any other topic! He helps us understand that in America, we're all wealthy by global standards - isn't it eye-opening to realize that 80% of humanity lives on less than $10 a day? PT shares touching stories about Impact Church's mission work in Nicaragua, where $1,500 builds an entire house for a family. Sometimes I think about how we stress over our coffee prices while others walk hours just for clean water. The sermon centers around three main questions: Can God trust me? Will I sacrifice to help build God's church? Will I put God first? PT explains that tithing isn't about tipping God - it's about honoring Him with our first fruits. I love how he breaks down the concept of first fruits using a simple banana tree example! The message culminates in a challenge to test God in tithing, the only place in Scripture where God explicitly invites us to test Him. Through Impact Church's 90-day tithe challenge, PT is inviting us to experience this truth for ourselves. With PT's passionate delivery (including some memorable moments preaching from the floor!), we're reminded that affluence isn't about what we have, but about how we use what God has entrusted to us.\",\n    \"tags\": [\"Tithing\", \"Faith\", \"Obedience\"],\n    \"mainPoints\": [\n\t\t\"Can God trust me with the resources He has given me?\",\n\t\t\"Am I willing to sacrifice to help build God's church?\",\n\t\t\"Is God truly first in my life, especially with my finances?\"\n    ],\n    \"versesMentioned\": [\n        { \"verse\": \"Luke 16:10-13\", \"text\": \"Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.

ahead tell them it's definitely not you it's definitely not you anyone who's never at fault in what they say is perfect able to keep their whole body in check when we put bits into the mouth of horses to make them obey us we can turn the whole animal or take ships as an example although they are so large and driven by strong winds they're steered by a very small Rudder wherever the pilot wants to go likewise the tongue is a small part of the body but it makes great boasts consider what a great Forest is set on fire by a small spark the tongue is also a fire a world of evil among the parts of the body it corrupts the whole body it sets the whole course of one's life on fire and is itself set on fire by hell verse S all kinds of animals birds reptiles sea creatures are being tamed and have been tamed by mankind but no human being can tame the tongue it is a Restless evil full of deadly poison with the tongue we praise our Lord and father and with it we curse human beings who have been made in God's likeness out of the same mouth come praise and cursing my brothers and sisters this should not be can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring my brothers and sisters can a fig tree bear olives or a grape Vine bear figs neither can a Salt Spring produce fresh water it's it's game time I'm going to pray would you bow your heads with me God we thank you for today we

world of evil it says that your tongue it's a Restless evil full of deadly poison so I've titled my message today get the monster out my mouth I want you to look at somebody and tell them real quick you need to get the monster out your mouth come on tell somebody you need to get the monster out your [Music] mouth well anyway if if you know you know if you don't you probably shouldn't know but look at somebody again and tell them he's talking to you today this one's for you baby this one's for you this one's for you you remember the the the most famous sermon ever preached was Jesus himself and he preached The Sermon on the Mount well today we're going to preach on the sermon on the mouth look at somebody and tell them this I know you're saved come on tell somebody I know you're saved I know you're saved now ask him this but is your mouth saved yeah cuz cuz I I know a lot of people man they they they say they love Jesus but the their mouths are no different many Christians their mouths are no different than the atheist like I love God but like your mouth looks no different from the person who doesn't even believe in God right many Christians like our mouths our mouths we we love God but we we we we have a problem with our mouth we we gossip oh Christians are the worst too the Christian gossip thing we gossip about people we call it prayer I got to want you to pray with me about so and so we call it prayer but we just it's really gossip we gossip we slander we lie men of God men of God belittling their wives belittling their children men and women of God tearing each other down biting each other backbiting each other other right cursing use of profanity negative all the time critical complaining oh that's the other thing Christians and the complaints dear God help us the complaining oh man Jesus help me come the complaining it's cold in here it's just I love the church but it's cold we have people complain we have we have people complain one day within the last calendar year they sent a letter it was that important to them that the photographers were in their way how about shut your eyes and worship Jesus and forget the photographers and whatever it is you're trying to see we have people complain when people show up late you know what I'm saying and I go hey guys we need to squeeze in and leave the edges open the seats open there's so many people coming I mean there's so many people people are like well well I got here early and I shouldn't have to move wow I've got an idea find another church bye like it's fine we're good with we actually need the space find a church where you can buy the seat and sit in it for the rest of your life till Jesus comes the complaining the complaining and some of you you like yeah that was me cuz like hey let me tell you something most people most people that are late are usually the firsttime guests cuz they don't realize you got to get here 4 hours early to get inside the building so they get here on time time and then we go I was here first the Christian complaining is out of con control and then and then what we do is we we gripe and we moan we groan about everything in life and and we we we we even are hateful toward one another and then we come to church on Sunday and we're just like Praise You Jesus and he says you you are a problem with your mouth will you curse men who have been made in the likeness of God you tear down that woman who's been made in the likeness you tear down that child you tear down your spouse you belittle your coworker you you you you curse people out you use profanity and then you come in you just like oh Jesus I love you he says this should not be look at somebody and tell them it shouldn't be like that shouldn't be like that this should not be what a powerful passage in James chapter 3 he says from the same mouth come praise and cursing from the same mouth from the same mouth I I praise God from the same mouth I'm profane yeah like like it shouldn't be that way my brothers and sisters should not be that way we're better than that we're bigger than that God calls us higher than that right like you you know you know the Shir because we all make excuses and we justify our stupidity so that we're comfortable staying in our stupidity you know there's these shirts is like I love Jesus and curse a little that's not a thing that's not a thing don't buy that shirt you need to love Jesus and never curse that's what God calls the man of God too and the woman of God you say man that's a tall yeah it's a tall ass that's why it's in the Bible thank God the Bible doesn't lower its standard to us we got to raise our standard to the Bible so he says it shouldn't be man the the word of God speaks I mean EX extensively explicitly about the way we use our mouths in fact there's this passage in Ephesians chapter 4 and and this is what these verses say starting in verse 29 he says don't let any UNH wholesome talk another translation says don't let any corrupt talk no unh wholesome talk come out of your mouth but only what is helpful only what is helpful helpful say the word helpful helpful helpful only what is helpful for building other up for building others up see that's what I want us to do today is to to start putting into practice how to build others up uh we're going to be encouragers not discouragers cuz some of y'all are professional discouragers we we we got to flush that down the the the drain it's time to be encouragers only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs that it may benefit those who listen and do not grieve the holy spirit of God with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption get rid of all bitterness rage anger brawling slander along with every form of malice be kind and compassionate to one another forgiving each other just as in Christ God forgave you amen you know the scariest thing about having a monster in your mouth and don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about cuz like all of a sudden that thing just came out of nowhere like you didn't even know it was in there and there's that moner the scariest thing about having a monster in your mouth means that you've got a monster in your heart it means that you have a monster in your mind or it would have never come out of your mouth right this is what Jesus said in Matthew 12 he said make a tree good and its fruit will be good or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad he says a tree is recognized by its fruit wait time out a tree is recognized by its fruit y'all know Jesus is not talking about trees what is he talking about people no no don't say people what's he talking about us me say it say it he's talking about me he's talking about me cuz it's easy to go people he's talking about people he's talking about everybody in here but this is really not talking about me he's talking about me he says a tree is recognized by its fruit not by what you say you are but by what the fruit shows that you are so then he says you brood of Viper ERS how can you who are evil say anything good for the mouth speaks what the heart is full of there it is right there for the mouth speaks what the heart is full of a good man brings the good things out of the good stored up of him in him and an evil man brings the evil things out of the evil stored up in him but I tell you that everyone this one's tough I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken I think it's interesting here because he says it J James he says it's a Restless evil full of deadly poison that's what he said in chapter 3 we just read it the the the the tongue the mouth it is a rest evil full of deadly poison and then Jesus the brother of James he said he calls him a brood of vipers right I think it's interesting because like the mouth is they're saying the same thing it's this venomous Viper the mouth is a a snake it's waiting to strike and release its venom and so Jesus said for your mouth speaks what your heart is full of I want to give you four points to to walk away with today I hope that you're taking notes if you've not downloaded our new app the notes are inside of it I think it's a great tool as Pastor darrison mentioned but number one is this is that my mouth rats me out come on yeah it it it does it rats you out your mouth is the tattletail of your heart right he says in a different translation for maybe you've heard it this way out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks that's why when you ever had somebody tell you something they're like don't I want to tell you something but don't tell anybody and you're like oh for sure I am a vault I would never and then they tell you and it's just so good it's so like no way are you kidding me your secret's good with me man and then you tell somebody how many you ever done that raise your hand raise your hand don't lie you fry you're in church how many have ever told somebody something that was told to you that was supposed to be kept a secret go raise your hand go go yeah that's that's the greater majority of all of us you are not trustworthy this is the untrustworthy service out of the mouth it it it speaks what is in of the heart and this is the idea it's like what you fill your heart with it is going to boil over at some point and it is going to come out of your mouth what does your mouth say about you if your mouth rats you out if your mouth tattletails on your heart then what does your mouth tattletail about you see if you've got a problem with your mouth it's a lot more serious than you might think because it means that you have a heart problem if you have a problem with your mouth it means that you have a mind problem and see Jesus says my brothers and sisters this should not be your words are the fruit that reveal feel the seeds planted in your heart have you ever noticed it doesn't take long to you you meet somebody new and you get into a conversation and within I mean within like 5 10 minutes I can tell you what's in their heart right it doesn't take long all it takes is a short conversation to see what's inside of their heart it doesn't take long a short five minute 10 minute conversation you can tell if somebody's bitter you can tell if somebody's broken you can tell if somebody is hurt or resentful you can tell if somebody is angry or jaded you can tell if somebody's full of guilt or shame or if they're filthy in their hearts you can tell right away because if their heart is full of it their mouth is going to spew it and and think about it like this a person with a harsh tongue they are revealing an angry heart a person with a negative tongue is revealing a fearful heart they're negative all the time oh I don't know if it's going to I worry about her it's you're revealing what's inside a person with an overactive tongue is a person with an unsettled heart a person that boasts all the time is revealing an insecure heart have you ever met somebody like that man they really love themselves they talk about themselves over and oh and me and me and me and I and I and I what they're actually revealing is the opposite of what they're saying they're revealing an insecure heart a person with the filthy mouth is revealing a filthy heart an impure heart a person who's critical all the time they have a bitter heart they have a bitter heart so our mouths they sell us out Jesus said for your mouth it speaks what the heart heart is full of it speaks what the heart is full of here's the good news you get to decide what your heart is full of you get to decide what your heart is filled with you are the gatekeeper of your mind of your heart you let me let me say it this way you are the only gatekeeper of your heart nobody else is going to keep it for you they're going to try to get in it right you are the only gatekeeper you are the only one that can say I am not letting that in my mind I am not letting that in my house I'm not letting that inside of me I am going to be a gatekeeper for my spiritual Temple by the way the Bible calls your body body the Temple of the Holy Spirit In other words the Holy Spirit dwells inside of this fleshly body it's the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit I I want to read these two verses to you because in 1 Corinthians 6:19 and 20 says do you not know that your bodies actually let's read it together you guys good with that okay here we go do you not know that your bodies are are temples of the Holy Spirit who is in you whom you have received from God you are not your own you were bought at a price therefore honor God with your bodies amen I mean if we're honest those two those two verses should change the way we live our lives yeah if my body is the Temple of the Holy Spirit it should change how I eat some of you like that's right PT that's right that's right preach that like I'm a gy rat I eat healthy my question is why on the spiritual question answer is the body is the temple the Scot answer is I'm insecure come on come on so I'm going to work out and work out and look good for you so that you think I'm great right that's the Scottdale answer yeah but for those of you watching in Indiana a whole different answer cause cuz every time I bring a preacher in a friend they're like man this is a good-look church man this is like the best looking church I I'm serious people say every this is like the best looking church I've ever and I'm like it is but the question is why cuz it's just as broken as as any church I've ever been in in my life right the question is why and that's what we really got to get down to is the motive so my temple is I is is is the dwelling space The Dwelling Place of God it should change how I live my life it should change everything about my it should change me and how I think of it physically let's just let's let's because that could be a sermon if your body is the temple of God physically which it is it should change the way you dress come on yeah I mean I mean it's like sh you know I I done got Miss got still boob job and butt job and foot job and calf job thigh job so I need to show it off is this too [Applause] much this this this is more 1230 [Applause] material why what I always think of it like this like for those of you that are single like a pringle look in the mingle and and if it I think of it in terms of fishing you know and when you you fish you use certain bait to catch certain fish and you you're going to you're going to catch what you're fishing for with the bait you're using and the bait you use determines the type of fish that you catch so you know you know I'm saying like you're single and you're a female and you look great you look great you know you're just you're so be and you're like but if I'm GNA fish me out of [Laughter] man is this too much I'm I'm telling you right now I can tell you what what kind of fish you going to catch you're going to catch a lust bucket don't you want a man of God I if you want a man of God cover up dress modestly say save all that for your man save all that for your man save all that for the one God has for you don't give that all the way to the world save it for your man save it save it this is this that I didn't say any of that in the first service I I do you not know that your bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit who is in you whom we receive you are not your own you were bought at a price what was the price it was the cross it was the cross he was crucified therefore honor God honor God honor God with your body this is this should change the way you live physically it should change the way you live emotionally what you take in emotionally right it should change how you live relationally spiritually listen if if it's the temple it's the house it's the dwelling place of God like would you just let would you just would you just let anything into your home in your home you know what I'm saying you go home tonight and you say I'm going to bed and you you you you unlock the doors and then you just open them and then you go to bed like nobody nobody with any kind of sense at all would do that and you're like well you know what you know what we'll take it as it comes we'll digest it as it comes whether I want it in whether I I don't want to once it's in it's in once it's in it's in so I got a responsibility to to protect to filter out to to keep to guard my heart that's what David said David said in Psalm 141 he said set a guard O Lord over my mouth keep watch over the doors of my lips because because he knows you Proverbs 4:23 it says above all else guard your heart for everything you do flows from it so God guard my heart and if my heart is guarded it is going to guard my mouth because change is always From the Inside Out not from the outside in so guard my heart I I'm careful and prayerful about what I give my mind to my attention to my eyes to my thoughts to my focus to right my ears too I I got to be careful I got to protect and filter number two write this down number two number two is that my mouth holds the power of life or death see Proverbs 18:20 we know this we know this we know that our words are that power our words are the most powerful force in the world it's not like ballistic missiles that those are power our words are the single most powerful force in the world you can tear down or you can build up with the words that you choose to use you can kill or you can resurrect it says in Proverbs 18:21 the tongue has the power of life and death and those who love it will eat its fruit think about it this way here's how powerful words are by God's word he spoke the heavens and earth into existence the word a spoken word it was by a word that the devil he deceived Eve in the garden of Eden it was by a word that Eve convinced Adam to partake of the same thing it's by our words words The Power of Words that we confess with our mouths that Jesus is lord it's by my words that I Repent it's by my words that I accept that I acknowledge Jesus in other words my words will determine my eternal destination that's how powerful are words are words the most powerful force in the world and and not just verbal words hey hey written words text messages emails comments social media comments I don't understand there's something about Humanity that's really weird we will say things that we would never say face to face but we will say things on a comment like they're like they like they're really not a human being on the other side like I could preach and I could say Jesus is Lord and somebody's going to say he didn't say that right heretic I'm not kidding I can say anything scripturally and somebody's going to have something to say about it like like there's not a human on the other you know what I'm saying it's like when you're driving in a car right you know what I'm saying you driving in a car there's another human in the car but you're in a car see you know what I'm saying you flip them off you curse them they're you think about this if you were in a grocery store you're in sprouts and you got your shopping cart and there's somebody in your way and they're taking forever and you're like dude get out in your head you're thinking like this person is see in a car we get flip them the bird can you imagine doing that in a grocery store pushing a cart like [Laughter] like what are we doing what are we doing like what are we even doing and and words words are so powerful that they can I have had words spoken to me that I remember at four and five years old that still try to linger in my head words that were negative words that were said to me that thank God by the grace of God and the power of God those words never took root and made me into something that God didn't want me to be thank God that God has the final word and that his word is the only true word cuz cuz words are like words are like seeds they they live far longer than the moment we plant them amen they live far longer and over time they grow and they take on a life of their own and and those words I I like how Jesus said good fruit bad fruit because your words either produce good fruit or bad fruit it's not like it's in between it's either good fruit or it's bad fruit what are your words producing what are they producing and the the reality is is that you cannot talk listen some of you you're so negative oh Lord Jesus you know what I'm saying you like it's not that everything the sky is falling the sky is falling on top of the other Sky that's falling like it's so bad like you you know what I'm saying like there's people are solutionists you're the problemist like you're trying to you you find the problem with every Solution that's how negtive you're negative with your words because you're negative with your heart and you cannot talk with your words negatively all the time and expect to live a positive life it's not going to happen you cannot speak with your lips defeat all the time and expect to live a life of Victory your words my words they're that powerful the the the truth is if you have a poor mouth if you've got a monster in your mouth you're going to have a poor life amen listen your words they can kill or they can heal your words I want you to write that down I want you to write it down my words can kill people or my words can heal people my words can kill people or my words can heal people see Proverbs 12 he writes thoughtless words is anybody guilty of thoughtless words I I sure am can wound as deeply as any sword but wisely spoken words can heal that's good that's good thoughtless words they can wound you like a sword but Wise Wise words words they they they they they can heal so my my words can kill people or my words can heal people your words could ruin somebody's life your words could ruin somebody's reputation your words could destroy somebody's career do you know that I have the power right here right now if I picked one of you out if I if I just picked one of you that I know and I know about you and I know what company that you own you know I could destroy it right here right now with this I could destroy you it it might not even be true doesn't matter that's how powerful words are that's how powerful words are I I I am so hesitant personally as a human I I don't really write reviews unless they're good reviews I never write reviews unless they're good reviews so the Googles and Yelps and all that I I I have a problem writing a review even if I had a bad experience because that's somebody on the other side who's trying that's their livelihood they're trying they're trying I could destroy them with one statement I could destroy them I try so hard listen your words they can ruin a reputation they can ruin your own reputation they can ruin a career they can ruin everything somebody's worked for because of your words you can destroy somebody's self-image somebody's self-esteem their self-worth confidence you can destroy somebody's peace somebody's Joy on the other hand you can speak life and you can edify and you can build up and you can encourage and you can heal people I I want to give you the A C and D of Point number two so if you're taking notes write this down how we should use our words letter a is use encouraging words use encouraging words use encouraging words okay it it's it's words that build others up can you do that Impact Church can you do that like starting today I'm going to encourage I'm going to build up because we live in such a toxic world that everything is negative everything's critical it's because the soul of cult is toxic when the soul of something is toxic the mouth of the same thing's going to be toxic so the soul of the nation is toxic it's polluted so the mouth of the nation is polluted it's poison I'm going to use my words to build up encourage instead of discourage encourage some of you I said your professional discouragers sh dude one one one of the early disciples his name was Barnabas you know what Barnabas barnabas' nickname was he was the encourager wouldn't that be a cool nickname the encourager I wish that was my nickname it's not but I'm working on it it's not not yet but I'm working on it it's not second nature for me to encourage I feel weird encouraging people it it does it feels weird you know what I'm saying like great job oh your hair looks so nice I just feel uncomfortable in my own sinful nature he he's the encourager I love that you know why he was his nickname was the encourager guess why cuz he was an encourager but it got me to thinking like what would your nickname be if the people closest to you gave you a nickname based on your character what would your nickname be we know Sister Kim's nickname would be praising God praise God she's a praiser she's a praiser well what would your what would your nickname be hey hey if you want to know ask people hey if you could if you could nickname me in one word based on like Who I Am What would the word be jerk betrayer backbiter belit I don't know I want to be an encourager I want to be an encourager listen some of you are so you're so discouraging you you wonder why nobody wants to be around you some of you listen some of you I just felt God right now speak to my heart some of you women you could be nicknamed the nag Nancy the nag do I got any NES in here today Nancy stand up please stand up please stand up Nancy the neck negative Nick got any Nicks in here any Nicks Nick I knew it I knew it negative Nick I um I don't know I I I just you know the nagging thing I can't I got to go back to it because you know it's hard not to nag but nagging doesn't actually get done what you're hoping oping it will get done nagging actually drives people away and actually drives people crazy and you go well if they just then I wouldn't nag yeah exactly but if you want to get done what you want to get done nagging does the opposite but what does work is encouraging and you say Well it there's not much to encourage well encourage the not much because the not much it starts to grow and it starts to go hey that felt good that felt really good that my wife encouraged me and said something positive for once if you don't want a nag for a wife treat her like a Thad I don't even know what that [Laughter] means all I heard was the first part if you don't want your wife to nag you're right I don't but see I think the problem problem with us as human beings is we always point fingers the other way and not at ourself and I think it's important that we point them at ourselves because yes yes the other person has flaws the other person has issues that does not negate the fact that so do you and so as we begin to focus on ourselves and allow God to to work on us see when I lay my life down for Natalie and Natalie lays her life down for Travis there's an Ephesians five reciprocal relationship that is the idea of marriage how does a marriage last for the strong marriages last forever it's because I give my life away for her she gives her life away for me but when I start getting into the well me me me me it's over in a hurry right so what what what what I would challenge you and and it's not just women I'm just being facies and joking at the same time a little bit serious but I if if if if you find yourself to be a a a person who nags at your loved ones my my my my challenge to you would be stop nagging on them and start bragging on them start bragging on me start bragging on me be an encourager God help us to be an encourager the the the letter B under Point number two letter B is to use gentle words gentle gentle words I'm so glad my wife is at the hospital with ailia right now because she would be like yeah this one's for you buddy and it is for me cuz I I don't use gentle words usually and then then when I do nobody else thought they were gentle but me I got a lot of work to do on the gentle words things I'm just too fiery and too too too passionate but but I need to learn to use gentle words Proverbs 15:4 it says that gentle words gentle words they cause life and health man that's good right there so I work on using gentle words even in hostile situations in your marriage with your children at work on social media in text messages use gentle words the the the third one letter C is to use kind words kind words did you know the Bible says your kindness will reward you your kindness will not only build somebody else up but your kindness will reward you but your cruelty will destroy you so I use kind words even when somebody's not kind even when somebody's mean or hateful toward me even when you're in an argument or a heated discussion you know there's ways that we can be in a debate and still remain kind there there are ways that we can still remain men and women of God even hard conversations even when we don't agree it doesn't mean that we can't be loving and kind and gentle and considerate and compassionate and empathetic have you ever thought about this the person that you're in a debate with they they're a human with emotions they have feelings just like you do right so he says your kindness will reward you I I've learned in my own life God God God spoke to me one day and and he said when you're in a heat of discussion when you're in that moment and you're you're in a you're in an argu arent your goal Travis your goal is not to be right it's to be righteous yeah and you know what that's hard you know why that's hard cuz I'm right every time I've ever been in an argument right I mean you too right we we wouldn't argue if we didn't think our position was a fact we wouldn't stand on an argument so we think we're right well they think they're right yeah well I think I'm right I think you're right no I saw it this way it didn't happen that way it was this way is the is the challenge is the goal to be right yeah I got news for you if you've ever been in an argument even if you are right the other person has never thought they were wrong so the goal isn't to be right it's to be righteous the goal isn't to be heard is to be holy God help us be righteous God help us be holy and I've also learned you know what never argue with a stupid person because they'll put pull you down to their level and then they're going to beat you with experience you know what I'm saying like never argue with a stupid person letter D under Point number two letter D is used few words not very many you know what's tough about this is this is easy for some people and hard for others cuz some of you you you don't talk much right and some of you talk way too much and and those of you that that that talk way too much this one's hard talk less use few use fewer words use fewer words use fewer words it say it says in Proverbs 17 it says a truly wise person truly wise truly wise person uses few words a person with understanding is even tempered even fools are thought wise when they keep silent with their mouth shut they seem intelligent let's just seem intelligent let's just seem like we're intelligent see the the the question I think we've got to ask is are are you are you wise are we wise a truly wise person uses few words are we wise do we have a mature mouth because that's the goal is to develop a spiritually mature mouth the Bible tells us he says a truly wise person uses few words a a spiritually mature person is not somebody hear me who goes to church every Sunday a spiritually mature person isn't somebody who comes in the church and just praise God praise God and shouts and hollers and Hypes no a spiritually one of the fundamental characteristics of a spiritually mature person is in how they use their words amen yeah how they use their words he he says in in in Proverbs 10:19 too much talk leads to sin be sensible and keep your mouth shut good keep it shut and there there are times there are to be honest most of the time when we just need to be quiet right be quiet don't don't write that text don't don't send have you ever written a text and you contemplated and then you send it you ever done that or have you ever written out a text and you like I better not and then you accidentally send it and now with iPhones there's this thing like unsend unsend unsend unsend unsend you don't you don't have to say what you think see the world world's telling you say what you think speak your mind let them know let them have it that's what the world that's not what the word says amen the word doesn't say that the word does not say that you should just speak your mind and let somebody know and let that's spiritual immaturity that is being Godless with our mouth Pro Proverbs 16:23 it says intelligent people think before they speak intelligent people think before they speak and and and then James so we just read James chapter 3 and the whole chapter is about the mouth and James chapter 1 in verse 19 here here's a different take on this but it's still about the mouth he says my brothers and sisters my dearest brothers and sisters take note of this take note make a note of this everybody write this down down write this down everyone should be quick to listen slow to speak and slow to become angry let's read that part out loud ready everyone should be quick to listen slow to speak and slow to become angry because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires everyone should be quick to listen slow to speak and we we get this whole thing backwards don't we yeah we're like everyone should be quick to speak quick to anger and slow to listen that's the world I live in everyone should be quick quick to to to speak speak your mind he said any anyone anyone everyone should be slow to speak yeah that even means like when you're in a conversation with somebody you know when you're in conf they just keep interrupting you slow to speak would mean like waiting for them to finish and some people don't finish or you're like me and you don't know how to know if they finish they pause for a second and you think they're done they weren't done quick to listen God gave you to your ears one mouth probably means we should listen more than we talk good right so so we're we're quick to listen slow to speak slow to become angry and then in Colossians chapter 4 he says let your conversation always be full of grace seasoned with salt let it be full of grace seasoned with salt okay in other words I need to work on words that are filled with grace you know what Grace is Grace is giving people what they don't deserve right amen that's good I I I I afford you what you don't deserve I'm going to take the high road I'm going to be filled with grace even when I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being treated poorly I'm going to love even when I'm hated I'm going to stay calm even when it's chaotic I'm going to stay kind-hearted when you're mean-spirited I'm going to be polite I'm going to be dignified I'm going to be SII civil I'm going to be considerate yeah that's good right there I'm going to be filled with grace okay number three write this down number three is that my mouth reveals my spiritual maturity it does if you ever want to know how spiritually mature you are pay attention to your mouth pay attention to what you say how you say it when you say it and if you even should say it it's all about the mouth I I am I spiritually mature pay attention to your mouth you know it's like when you go to the doctor and you don't feel good and the doctor says open your mouth and say ah it's the same spiritually on spiritually you can tell how sick you are by your mouth you can tell how healthy you are by your mouth because the mouth of the mature can only come from the heart of the mature see Paul said this remember this was inside of a chapter that we call the love chapter in 1 Corinthians chapter 13 Paul spends all of this chapter talking about like what Love Actually is he defines what love is love is patient love is kind right love is not self like oh look at me look at me I'm not I'm puffed up I'm building up myself so he defines what love is and then towards the end of that chapter in verse 11 in the same chapter he says when I was a child I spoke like a child I thought like a child I reasoned like a child but when I became a man I gave up childish things see there's a lot of people sitting in church every week that are growing older but they've never grown up that's good you don't miss church you come every week you're faithful to go to church you're growing older but you're not growing up he says when I was a child yeah I spoke like a child but I but I grew up I thought like a child but I grew up I reasoned I contemplated like a child but I grew up see some of us we need to grow up some people they're 50y olds trapped in a one-year-old uh body that throwing Tantrums can you imagine being born and you still look like you're one but you're 50 like you're you you know what I'm saying there's no spiritual maturity there's a lot of Binky Believers there's a lot there's a lot of Binky Believers you got to keep pacifying them pacify them pacify them pacify them pacify them pacifying feed me py what you got for me Pete I know it's going to be good today what you got for yourself man and get your face in the word of God and start growing spiritually you you do it you do it you take some ownership you start growing Binky Believers bottle Believers you still on bottles lots of different kinds of bottles in here some of you just threw down bottles in South Scott still last night and barely made it church today but we justify it don't we I curse a little but I love Jesus I drink a little but I love Jesus you didn't drink a little you're trashed we like to justify it because if we can justify it it takes away the conviction or at least masks the conviction we at least can feel better about our stupidity God doesn't want us to feel better about our stupidity he wants us to grow up in maturity to become spiritually mature to grow in our Purity to grow in our Purity than you Believers dir diapers disciples you there's a book there's a book in the Bible called Hebrews and it's not it wasn't a coffee shop so dumb and Hebrew you know what Hebrew if I could sum up Hebrews in one word you know what it is maturity yeah Hebrews is a book about growing up spiritually that's what the book is about Hebrews so I I want to read you this scripture in Hebrews 5 he says by now you should have been teacher this is for some some of you should be teachers but once again you need to be taught the simplest things about what God has said you need milk instead of solid food people who live on milk are like babies who don't really know what is right woo I don't know is that right I don't know God really say that I don't know maybe the Bible's dated I don't know I don't know I mean it says I shouldn't kill anybody but did he really mean that maybe that was for 4,000 years ago shall not murder I feel like murdering shouldn't shouldn't commit adultery why not I should have 3 four 5 6 7 8 nine 10 wives if I want it's America am I wrong no and it's in every area of our life like whatever we want to whatever we individually want to do whatever you whatever I want to do individually that's against God's word I have to make I have to justify it somehow so that I can live with myself so that I can live with myself see he say he says you you you need to grow up man you need to grow up solid food is for mature people who have been trained to know right from wrong God wants you to grow up and not be a spiritual baby but to be spiritually mature so there there's power in our words and our words reveal what's in our heart our mouths they rat us out our mouths they have the power of life and death our mouths they reveal our spiritual maturity and number four here's the last one number four is that my words they have eternal consequences not just temporal consequences Proverbs 18 says in verse 20 that you will have to live with the consequences of everything you say you will have to live with the consequences of everything you say right this is one verse before this is one verse before he says your words have the power of life and death you your your words have the power of life and death he says you will have to live with the consequences of every you guys that's frightening it's frightening because once you let those words fly you can never take them back you can't get them back you could say I'm sorry you could say forgive me you could say that was stupid of me I shouldn't have done that I shouldn't have said that I didn't mean that but they will never ever forget that they might forgive you but they won't forget it because that hurts it pierces and we've all been victims of that but we've also all been people who have used the swords on others in that very same manner so he says you're going to have to live with the consequences what you say can affect somebody positively Ney for the rest of their life not not for like now like for the rest of their life forever forever and then there are Eternal consequences we we read this earlier Jesus said in Matthew 12 he said I'm telling you that everyone that's you that's me we're going to have to give an account on the day of judgment for every empty word that we have spoken listen you tell me that's not terrifying if you believe in the same God that I believe in if you believe in the the same Bible that I believe in you are going to stand alone before God on Judgment Day and he's not going to say hey tell me about your mama's Faith hey tell me about your Grandmama's Faith he's not going to say hey hey by the way man you made a lot of money gosh Come On In no no no we're going to stand there by ourselves he doesn't care he doesn't care about he when you stand before God he he doesn't care about how much money you made on Earth he doesn't care how much you you brought in he is going to care about how much you gave away did you give your life away did you lay your life down for others because that's what love truly is did you lay it all down he he says you're going to have to give an account man for every empty word another translation says for Every Idle Word that's terrifying can you imagine like I just want to forget about the things I've said that hurt people don't you you can for for now you can try to trick yourself into forgetting about they're G he's going to ask you about it it's like here is a list of every Idol word that you've ever spoken let's talk about those you'll have to give an account see our our words are are eternal Eternal and that's why it's important that we get the monster out of our mouths now we get the monster out of our hearts now and the fact is if you want to change your mouth you've got to allow God to change your heart the good news is God changes Hearts he changes hearts and many of you are living testimonies to how God has changed your life you're here today and you say you know what I'm not who I used to be can anybody testify I'm not who I used to be Pastor tra I'm not who I used to be I can testify to the goodness of God the power of God working from the inside out thank God I'm not Hey listen I'm not everything God wants me to be but I'm not who I used to be God is changing me from the inside out I love this scripture in Ezekiel 36 he says and I will give you a new heart and I'll put a new spirit in you that's the God we serve I'm going to take out your Stony stubborn heart and give you a tender responsive heart I love that that that that he since he said some of you here today your heart's hard it you you didn't just one day go I want a hard heart life hurts experiences hardships betrayal it it made your heart hard and I can't I can't soften in a hard heart but God can God can you know when we when we have our baptism service at the 12:30 service today and and and and every you know what I love watching I love it's my favorite service of any services that we ever do is baptisms because I watch people get into a tank of water I watch it it's it's enjoyable to watch a child that's cool last month right over here there was this young man he maybe was 10 he was balling I'm telling you the power of God was sitting on this young F he was balling it made me cry it made everybody in the front row cry it was so powerful but you know what the ones that get me are the men big grown tough men they go man God has broken me and softened me and he has change my heart when I see a man get into the water and a man starts to cry I say that's the god that's the God right there that I serve That's The God Who I know changed my own life and it's the same God that can change your life would you bow your heads with me and let's close in prayer the the the Bible says this is how powerful our mouths are this is how powerful in Romans 10:9 it says if you declare with your mouth Jesus is Lord and if you believe in in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved oh I love that if you declare with your mouth he didn't say if you if you think Jesus is Lord he didn't say if you declare with your mind no he said if you declare with your mouth Jesus is Lord do I got anybody today that would say that right now Jesus is Lord I declare it out loud with my mouth Jesus is Lord Jesus is Lord Jesus you are the Lord of my life you are the master of my life you are my savior God I confess I declare with my mouth I believe it in my heart and God I pray today that you give us a new heart God that you trade that old stubborn Stony

powerful message delivered in this sermon! In this powerful message about affluence and stewardship, Pastor Travis Hearn (PT) delivers a convicting yet encouraging sermon about our relationship with money. You know how we sometimes get uncomfortable when churches talk about money? PT addresses this head-on, reminding us that Jesus actually taught more about money than any other topic! He helps us understand that in America, we're all wealthy by global standards - isn't it eye-opening to realize that 80% of humanity lives on less than $10 a day? PT shares touching stories about Impact Church's mission work in Nicaragua, where $1,500 builds an entire house for a family. Sometimes I think about how we stress over our coffee prices while others walk hours just for clean water. The sermon centers around three main questions: Can God trust me? Will I sacrifice to help build God's church? Will I put God first? PT explains that tithing isn't about tipping God - it's about honoring Him with our first fruits. I love how he breaks down the concept of first fruits using a simple banana tree example! The message culminates in a challenge to test God in tithing, the only place in Scripture where God explicitly invites us to test Him. Through Impact Church's 90-day tithe challenge, PT is inviting us to experience this truth for ourselves. With PT's passionate delivery (including some memorable moments preaching from the floor!), we're reminded that affluence isn't about what we have, but about how we use what God has entrusted to us.\",\n    \"tags\": [\"Tithing\", \"Faith\", \"Obedience\"],\n    \"mainPoints\": [\n\t\t\"Can God trust me with the resources He has given me?\",\n\t\t\"Am I willing to sacrifice to help build God's church?\",\n\t\t\"Is God truly first in my life, especially with my finances?\"\n    ],\n    \"versesMentioned\": [\n        { \"verse\": \"Luke 16:10-13\", \"text\": \"Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.

into the mouth of horses to make them obey us we can turn the whole animal or take ships as an example although they are so large and driven by strong winds they're steered by a very small Rudder wherever the pilot wants to go likewise the tongue is a small part of the body but it makes great boasts consider what a great Forest is set on fire by a small spark the tongue is also a fire a world of evil among the parts of the body it corrupts the whole body it sets the whole course of one's life on fire and is itself set on fire by hell verse S all kinds of animals birds reptiles sea creatures are being tamed and have been tamed by mankind but no human being can tame the tongue it is a Restless evil full of deadly poison with the tongue we praise our Lord and father and with it we curse human beings who have been made in God's likeness out of the same mouth come praise and cursing my brothers and sisters this should not be can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring my brothers and sisters can a fig tree bear olives or a grape Vine bear figs neither can a Salt Spring produce fresh water it's it's game time I'm going to pray would you bow your heads with me

your tongue it is a fire it is a world of evil it says that your tongue it's a Restless evil full of deadly poison so I've titled my message today get the monster out my mouth I want you to look at somebody and tell them real quick you need to get the monster out your mouth come on tell somebody you need to get the monster out your [Music] mouth well anyway if if you know you know if you don't you probably shouldn't know but look at somebody again and tell them he's talking to you today this one's for you baby this one's for you this one's for you you remember the the the most famous sermon ever preached was Jesus himself and he preached The Sermon on the Mount well today we're going to preach on the sermon on the mouth look at somebody and tell them this I know you're saved come on tell somebody I know you're saved I know you're saved now ask him this but is your mouth saved yeah cuz cuz I I know a lot of people man they they they say they love Jesus but the their mouths are no different many Christians their mouths are no different than the atheist like I love God but like your mouth looks no different from the person who doesn't even believe in God right many Christians like our mouths our mouths we we love God but we we we we have a problem with our mouth we we gossip oh Christians are the worst too the Christian gossip thing we gossip about people we call it prayer I got to want you to pray with me about so and so we call it prayer but we just it's really gossip we gossip we slander we lie men of God men of God belittling their wives belittling their children men and women of God tearing each other down biting each other backbiting each other other right cursing use of profanity negative all the time critical complaining oh that's the other thing Christians and the complaints dear God help us the complaining oh man Jesus help me come the complaining it's cold in here it's just I love the church but it's cold we have people complain we have we have people complain one day within the last calendar year they sent a letter it was that important to them that the photographers were in their way how about shut your eyes and worship Jesus and forget the photographers and whatever it is you're trying to see we have people complain when people show up late you know what I'm saying and I go hey guys we need to squeeze in and leave the edges open the seats open there's so many people coming I mean there's so many people people are like well well I got here early and I shouldn't have to move wow I've got an idea find another church bye like it's fine we're good with we actually need the space find a church where you can buy the seat and sit in it for the rest of your life till Jesus comes the complaining the complaining and some of you you like yeah that was me cuz like hey let me tell you something most people most people that are late are usually the firsttime guests cuz they don't realize you got to get here 4 hours early to get inside the building so they get here on time time and then we go I was here first the Christian complaining is out of con control and then and then what we do is we we gripe and we moan we groan about everything in life and and we we we we even are hateful toward one another and then we come to church on Sunday and we're just like Praise You Jesus and he says you you are a problem with your mouth will you curse men who have been made in the likeness of God you tear down that woman who's been made in the likeness you tear down that child you tear down your spouse you belittle your coworker you you you you curse people out you use profanity and then you come in you just like oh Jesus I love you he says this should not be look at somebody and tell them it shouldn't be like that shouldn't be like that this should not be what a powerful passage in James chapter 3 he says from the same mouth come praise and cursing from the same mouth from the same mouth I I praise God from the same mouth I'm profane yeah like like it shouldn't be that way my brothers and sisters should not be that way we're better than that we're bigger than that God calls us higher than that right like you you know you know the Shir because we all make excuses and we justify our stupidity so that we're comfortable staying in our stupidity you know there's these shirts is like I love Jesus and curse a little that's not a thing that's not a thing don't buy that shirt you need to love Jesus and never curse that's what God calls the man of God too and the woman of God you say man that's a tall yeah it's a tall ass that's why it's in the Bible thank God the Bible doesn't lower its standard to us we got to raise our standard to the Bible so he says it shouldn't be man the the word of God speaks I mean EX extensively explicitly about the way we use our mouths in fact there's this passage in Ephesians chapter 4 and and this is what these verses say starting in verse 29 he says don't let any UNH wholesome talk another translation says don't let any corrupt talk no unh wholesome talk come out of your mouth but only what is helpful only what is helpful helpful say the word helpful helpful helpful only what is helpful for building other up for building others up see that's what I want us to do today is to to start putting into practice how to build others up uh we're going to be encouragers not discouragers cuz some of y'all are professional discouragers we we we got to flush that down the the the drain it's time to be encouragers only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs that it may benefit those who listen and do not grieve the holy spirit of God with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption get rid of all bitterness rage anger brawling slander along with every form of malice be kind and compassionate to one another forgiving each other just as in Christ God forgave you amen you know the scariest thing about having a monster in your mouth and don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about cuz like all of a sudden that thing just came out of nowhere like you didn't even know it was in there and there's that moner the scariest thing about having a monster in your mouth means that you've got a monster in your heart it means that you have a monster in your mind or it would have never come out of your mouth right this is what Jesus said in Matthew 12 he said make a tree good and its fruit will be good or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad he says a tree is recognized by its fruit wait time out a tree is recognized by its fruit y'all know Jesus is not talking about trees what is he talking about people no no don't say people what's he talking about us me say it say it he's talking about me he's talking about me cuz it's easy to go people he's talking about people he's talking about everybody in here but this is really not talking about me he's talking about me he says a tree is recognized by its fruit not by what you say you are but by what the fruit shows that you are so then he says you brood of Viper ERS how can you who are evil say anything good for the mouth speaks what the heart is full of there it is right there for the mouth speaks what the heart is full of a good man brings the good things out of the good stored up of him in him and an evil man brings the evil things out of the evil stored up in him but I tell you that everyone this one's tough I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken I think it's interesting here because he says it J James he says it's a Restless evil full of deadly poison that's what he said in chapter 3 we just read it the the the the tongue the mouth it is a rest evil full of deadly poison and then Jesus the brother of James he said he calls him a brood of vipers right I think it's interesting because like the mouth is they're saying the same thing it's this venomous Viper the mouth is a a snake it's waiting to strike and release its venom and so Jesus said for your mouth speaks what your heart is full of I want to give you four points to to walk away with today I hope that you're taking notes if you've not downloaded our new app the notes are inside of it I think it's a great tool as Pastor darrison mentioned but number one is this is that my mouth rats me out come on yeah it it it does it rats you out your mouth is the tattletail of your heart right he says in a different translation for maybe you've heard it this way out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks that's why when you ever had somebody tell you something they're like don't I want to tell you something but don't tell anybody and you're like oh for sure I am a vault I would never and then they tell you and it's just so good it's so like no way are you kidding me your secret's good with me man and then you tell somebody how many you ever done that raise your hand raise your hand don't lie you fry you're in church how many have ever told somebody something that was told to you that was supposed to be kept a secret go raise your hand go go yeah that's that's the greater majority of all of us you are not trustworthy this is the untrustworthy service out of the mouth it it it speaks what is in of the heart and this is the idea it's like what you fill your heart with it is going to boil over at some point and it is going to come out of your mouth what does your mouth say about you if your mouth rats you out if your mouth tattletails on your heart then what does your mouth tattletail about you see if you've got a problem with your mouth it's a lot more serious than you might think because it means that you have a heart problem if you have a problem with your mouth it means that you have a mind problem and see Jesus says my brothers and sisters this should not be your words are the fruit that reveal feel the seeds planted in your heart have you ever noticed it doesn't take long to you you meet somebody new and you get into a conversation and within I mean within like 5 10 minutes I can tell you what's in their heart right it doesn't take long all it takes is a short conversation to see what's inside of their heart it doesn't take long a short five minute 10 minute conversation you can tell if somebody's bitter you can tell if somebody's broken you can tell if somebody is hurt or resentful you can tell if somebody is angry or jaded you can tell if somebody's full of guilt or shame or if they're filthy in their hearts you can tell right away because if their heart is full of it their mouth is going to spew it and and think about it like this a person with a harsh tongue they are revealing an angry heart a person with a negative tongue is revealing a fearful heart they're negative all the time oh I don't know if it's going to I worry about her it's you're revealing what's inside a person with an overactive tongue is a person with an unsettled heart a person that boasts all the time is revealing an insecure heart have you ever met somebody like that man they really love themselves they talk about themselves over and oh and me and me and me and I and I and I what they're actually revealing is the opposite of what they're saying they're revealing an insecure heart a person with the filthy mouth is revealing a filthy heart an impure heart a person who's critical all the time they have a bitter heart they have a bitter heart so our mouths they sell us out Jesus said for your mouth it speaks what the heart heart is full of it speaks what the heart is full of here's the good news you get to decide what your heart is full of you get to decide what your heart is filled with you are the gatekeeper of your mind of your heart you let me let me say it this way you are the only gatekeeper of your heart nobody else is going to keep it for you they're going to try to get in it right you are the only gatekeeper you are the only one that can say I am not letting that in my mind I am not letting that in my house I'm not letting that inside of me I am going to be a gatekeeper for my spiritual Temple by the way the Bible calls your body body the Temple of the Holy Spirit In other words the Holy Spirit dwells inside of this fleshly body it's the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit I I want to read these two verses to you because in 1 Corinthians 6:19 and 20 says do you not know that your bodies actually let's read it together you guys good with that okay here we go do you not know that your bodies are are temples of the Holy Spirit who is in you whom you have received from God you are not your own you were bought at a price therefore honor God with your bodies amen I mean if we're honest those two those two verses should change the way we live our lives yeah if my body is the Temple of the Holy Spirit it should change how I eat some of you like that's right PT that's right that's right preach that like I'm a gy rat I eat healthy my question is why on the spiritual question answer is the body is the temple the Scot answer is I'm insecure come on come on so I'm going to work out and work out and look good for you so that you think I'm great right that's the Scottdale answer yeah but for those of you watching in Indiana a whole different answer cause cuz every time I bring a preacher in a friend they're like man this is a good-look church man this is like the best looking church I I'm serious people say every this is like the best looking church I've ever and I'm like it is but the question is why cuz it's just as broken as as any church I've ever been in in my life right the question is why and that's what we really got to get down to is the motive so my temple is I is is is the dwelling space The Dwelling Place of God it should change how I live my life it should change everything about my it should change me and how I think of it physically let's just let's let's because that could be a sermon if your body is the temple of God physically which it is it should change the way you dress come on yeah I mean I mean it's like sh you know I I done got Miss got still boob job and butt job and foot job and calf job thigh job so I need to show it off is this too [Applause] much this this this is more 1230 [Applause] material why what I always think of it like this like for those of you that are single like a pringle look in the mingle and and if it I think of it in terms of fishing you know and when you you fish you use certain bait to catch certain fish and you you're going to you're going to catch what you're fishing for with the bait you're using and the bait you use determines the type of fish that you catch so you know you know I'm saying like you're single and you're a female and you look great you look great you know you're just you're so be and you're like but if I'm GNA fish me out of [Laughter] man is this too much I'm I'm telling you right now I can tell you what what kind of fish you going to catch you're going to catch a lust bucket don't you want a man of God I if you want a man of God cover up dress modestly say save all that for your man save all that for your man save all that for the one God has for you don't give that all the way to the world save it for your man save it save it this is this that I didn't say any of that in the first service I I do you not know that your bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit who is in you whom we receive you are not your own you were bought at a price what was the price it was the cross it was the cross he was crucified therefore honor God honor God honor God with your body this is this should change the way you live physically it should change the way you live emotionally what you take in emotionally right it should change how you live relationally spiritually listen if if it's the temple it's the house it's the dwelling place of God like would you just let would you just would you just let anything into your home in your home you know what I'm saying you go home tonight and you say I'm going to bed and you you you you unlock the doors and then you just open them and then you go to bed like nobody nobody with any kind of sense at all would do that and you're like well you know what you know what we'll take it as it comes we'll digest it as it comes whether I want it in whether I I don't want to once it's in it's in once it's in it's in so I got a responsibility to to protect to filter out to to keep to guard my heart that's what David said David said in Psalm 141 he said set a guard O Lord over my mouth keep watch over the doors of my lips because because he knows you Proverbs 4:23 it says above all else guard your heart for everything you do flows from it so God guard my heart and if my heart is guarded it is going to guard my mouth because change is always From the Inside Out not from the outside in so guard my heart I I'm careful and prayerful about what I give my mind to my attention to my eyes to my thoughts to my focus to right my ears too I I got to be careful I got to protect and filter number two write this down number two number two is that my mouth holds the power of life or death see Proverbs 18:20 we know this we know this we know that our words are that power our words are the most powerful force in the world it's not like ballistic missiles that those are power our words are the single most powerful force in the world you can tear down or you can build up with the words that you choose to use you can kill or you can resurrect it says in Proverbs 18:21 the tongue has the power of life and death and those who love it will eat its fruit think about it this way here's how powerful words are by God's word he spoke the heavens and earth into existence the word a spoken word it was by a word that the devil he deceived Eve in the garden of Eden it was by a word that Eve convinced Adam to partake of the same thing it's by our words words The Power of Words that we confess with our mouths that Jesus is lord it's by my words that I Repent it's by my words that I accept that I acknowledge Jesus in other words my words will determine my eternal destination that's how powerful are words are words the most powerful force in the world and and not just verbal words hey hey written words text messages emails comments social media comments I don't understand there's something about Humanity that's really weird we will say things that we would never say face to face but we will say things on a comment like they're like they like they're really not a human being on the other side like I could preach and I could say Jesus is Lord and somebody's going to say he didn't say that right heretic I'm not kidding I can say anything scripturally and somebody's going to have something to say about it like like there's not a human on the other you know what I'm saying it's like when you're driving in a car right you know what I'm saying you driving in a car there's another human in the car but you're in a car see you know what I'm saying you flip them off you curse them they're you think about this if you were in a grocery store you're in sprouts and you got your shopping cart and there's somebody in your way and they're taking forever and you're like dude get out in your head you're thinking like this person is see in a car we get flip them the bird can you imagine doing that in a grocery store pushing a cart like [Laughter] like what are we doing what are we doing like what are we even doing and and words words are so powerful that they can I have had words spoken to me that I remember at four and five years old that still try to linger in my head words that were negative words that were said to me that thank God by the grace of God and the power of God those words never took root and made me into something that God didn't want me to be thank God that God has the final word and that his word is the only true word cuz cuz words are like words are like seeds they they live far longer than the moment we plant them amen they live far longer and over time they grow and they take on a life of their own and and those words I I like how Jesus said good fruit bad fruit because your words either produce good fruit or bad fruit it's not like it's in between it's either good fruit or it's bad fruit what are your words producing what are they producing and the the reality is is that you cannot talk listen some of you you're so negative oh Lord Jesus you know what I'm saying you like it's not that everything the sky is falling the sky is falling on top of the other Sky that's falling like it's so bad like you you know what I'm saying like there's people are solutionists you're the problemist like you're trying to you you find the problem with every Solution that's how negtive you're negative with your words because you're negative with your heart and you cannot talk with your words negatively all the time and expect to live a positive life it's not going to happen you cannot speak with your lips defeat all the time and expect to live a life of Victory your words my words they're that powerful the the the truth is if you have a poor mouth if you've got a monster in your mouth you're going to have a poor life amen listen your words they can kill or they can heal your words I want you to write that down I want you to write it down my words can kill people or my words can heal people my words can kill people or my words can heal people see Proverbs 12 he writes thoughtless words is anybody guilty of thoughtless words I I sure am can wound as deeply as any sword but wisely spoken words can heal that's good that's good thoughtless words they can wound you like a sword but Wise Wise words words they they they they they can heal so my my words can kill people or my words can heal people your words could ruin somebody's life your words could ruin somebody's reputation your words could destroy somebody's career do you know that I have the power right here right now if I picked one of you out if I if I just picked one of you that I know and I know about you and I know what company that you own you know I could destroy it right here right now with this I could destroy you it it might not even be true doesn't matter that's how powerful words are that's how powerful words are I I I am so hesitant personally as a human I I don't really write reviews unless they're good reviews I never write reviews unless they're good reviews so the Googles and Yelps and all that I I I have a problem writing a review even if I had a bad experience because that's somebody on the other side who's trying that's their livelihood they're trying they're trying I could destroy them with one statement I could destroy them I try so hard listen your words they can ruin a reputation they can ruin your own reputation they can ruin a career they can ruin everything somebody's worked for because of your words you can destroy somebody's self-image somebody's self-esteem their self-worth confidence you can destroy somebody's peace somebody's Joy on the other hand you can speak life and you can edify and you can build up and you can encourage and you can heal people I I want to give you the A C and D of Point number two so if you're taking notes write this down how we should use our words letter a is use encouraging words use encouraging words use encouraging words okay it it's it's words that build others up can you do that Impact Church can you do that like starting today I'm going to encourage I'm going to build up because we live in such a toxic world that everything is negative everything's critical it's because the soul of cult is toxic when the soul of something is toxic the mouth of the same thing's going to be toxic so the soul of the nation is toxic it's polluted so the mouth of the nation is polluted it's poison I'm going to use my words to build up encourage instead of discourage encourage some of you I said your professional discouragers sh dude one one one of the early disciples his name was Barnabas you know what Barnabas barnabas' nickname was he was the encourager wouldn't that be a cool nickname the encourager I wish that was my nickname it's not but I'm working on it it's not not yet but I'm working on it it's not second nature for me to encourage I feel weird encouraging people it it does it feels weird you know what I'm saying like great job oh your hair looks so nice I just feel uncomfortable in my own sinful nature he he's the encourager I love that you know why he was his nickname was the encourager guess why cuz he was an encourager but it got me to thinking like what would your nickname be if the people closest to you gave you a nickname based on your character what would your nickname be we know Sister Kim's nickname would be praising God praise God she's a praiser she's a praiser well what would your what would your nickname be hey hey if you want to know ask people hey if you could if you could nickname me in one word based on like Who I Am What would the word be jerk betrayer backbiter belit I don't know I want to be an encourager I want to be an encourager listen some of you are so you're so discouraging you you wonder why nobody wants to be around you some of you listen some of you I just felt God right now speak to my heart some of you women you could be nicknamed the nag Nancy the nag do I got any NES in here today Nancy stand up please stand up please stand up Nancy the neck negative Nick got any Nicks in here any Nicks Nick I knew it I knew it negative Nick I um I don't know I I I just you know the nagging thing I can't I got to go back to it because you know it's hard not to nag but nagging doesn't actually get done what you're hoping oping it will get done nagging actually drives people away and actually drives people crazy and you go well if they just then I wouldn't nag yeah exactly but if you want to get done what you want to get done nagging does the opposite but what does work is encouraging and you say Well it there's not much to encourage well encourage the not much because the not much it starts to grow and it starts to go hey that felt good that felt really good that my wife encouraged me and said something positive for once if you don't want a nag for a wife treat her like a Thad I don't even know what that [Laughter] means all I heard was the first part if you don't want your wife to nag you're right I don't but see I think the problem problem with us as human beings is we always point fingers the other way and not at ourself and I think it's important that we point them at ourselves because yes yes the other person has flaws the other person has issues that does not negate the fact that so do you and so as we begin to focus on ourselves and allow God to to work on us see when I lay my life down for Natalie and Natalie lays her life down for Travis there's an Ephesians five reciprocal relationship that is the idea of marriage how does a marriage last for the strong marriages last forever it's because I give my life away for her she gives her life away for me but when I start getting into the well me me me me it's over in a hurry right so what what what what I would challenge you and and it's not just women I'm just being facies and joking at the same time a little bit serious but I if if if if you find yourself to be a a a person who nags at your loved ones my my my my challenge to you would be stop nagging on them and start bragging on them start bragging on me start bragging on me be an encourager God help us to be an encourager the the the letter B under Point number two letter B is to use gentle words gentle gentle words I'm so glad my wife is at the hospital with ailia right now because she would be like yeah this one's for you buddy and it is for me cuz I I don't use gentle words usually and then then when I do nobody else thought they were gentle but me I got a lot of work to do on the gentle words things I'm just too fiery and too too too passionate but but I need to learn to use gentle words Proverbs 15:4 it says that gentle words gentle words they cause life and health man that's good right there so I work on using gentle words even in hostile situations in your marriage with your children at work on social media in text messages use gentle words the the the third one letter C is to use kind words kind words did you know the Bible says your kindness will reward you your kindness will not only build somebody else up but your kindness will reward you but your cruelty will destroy you so I use kind words even when somebody's not kind even when somebody's mean or hateful toward me even when you're in an argument or a heated discussion you know there's ways that we can be in a debate and still remain kind there there are ways that we can still remain men and women of God even hard conversations even when we don't agree it doesn't mean that we can't be loving and kind and gentle and considerate and compassionate and empathetic have you ever thought about this the person that you're in a debate with they they're a human with emotions they have feelings just like you do right so he says your kindness will reward you I I've learned in my own life God God God spoke to me one day and and he said when you're in a heat of discussion when you're in that moment and you're you're in a you're in an argu arent your goal Travis your goal is not to be right it's to be righteous yeah and you know what that's hard you know why that's hard cuz I'm right every time I've ever been in an argument right I mean you too right we we wouldn't argue if we didn't think our position was a fact we wouldn't stand on an argument so we think we're right well they think they're right yeah well I think I'm right I think you're right no I saw it this way it didn't happen that way it was this way is the is the challenge is the goal to be right yeah I got news for you if you've ever been in an argument even if you are right the other person has never thought they were wrong so the goal isn't to be right it's to be righteous the goal isn't to be heard is to be holy God help us be righteous God help us be holy and I've also learned you know what never argue with a stupid person because they'll put pull you down to their level and then they're going to beat you with experience you know what I'm saying like never argue with a stupid person letter D under Point number two letter D is used few words not very many you know what's tough about this is this is easy for some people and hard for others cuz some of you you you don't talk much right and some of you talk way too much and and those of you that that that talk way too much this one's hard talk less use few use fewer words use fewer words use fewer words it say it says in Proverbs 17 it says a truly wise person truly wise truly wise person uses few words a person with understanding is even tempered even fools are thought wise when they keep silent with their mouth shut they seem intelligent let's just seem intelligent let's just seem like we're intelligent see the the the question I think we've got to ask is are are you are you wise are we wise a truly wise person uses few words are we wise do we have a mature mouth because that's the goal is to develop a spiritually mature mouth the Bible tells us he says a truly wise person uses few words a a spiritually mature person is not somebody hear me who goes to church every Sunday a spiritually mature person isn't somebody who comes in the church and just praise God praise God and shouts and hollers and Hypes no a spiritually one of the fundamental characteristics of a spiritually mature person is in how they use their words amen yeah how they use their words he he says in in in Proverbs 10:19 too much talk leads to sin be sensible and keep your mouth shut good keep it shut and there there are times there are to be honest most of the time when we just need to be quiet right be quiet don't don't write that text don't don't send have you ever written a text and you contemplated and then you send it you ever done that or have you ever written out a text and you like I better not and then you accidentally send it and now with iPhones there's this thing like unsend unsend unsend unsend unsend you don't you don't have to say what you think see the world world's telling you say what you think speak your mind let them know let them have it that's what the world that's not what the word says amen the word doesn't say that the word does not say that you should just speak your mind and let somebody know and let that's spiritual immaturity that is being Godless with our mouth Pro Proverbs 16:23 it says intelligent people think before they speak intelligent people think before they speak and and and then James so we just read James chapter 3 and the whole chapter is about the mouth and James chapter 1 in verse 19 here here's a different take on this but it's still about the mouth he says my brothers and sisters my dearest brothers and sisters take note of this take note make a note of this everybody write this down down write this down everyone should be quick to listen slow to speak and slow to become angry let's read that part out loud ready everyone should be quick to listen slow to speak and slow to become angry because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires everyone should be quick to listen slow to speak and we we get this whole thing backwards don't we yeah we're like everyone should be quick to speak quick to anger and slow to listen that's the world I live in everyone should be quick quick to to to speak speak your mind he said any anyone anyone everyone should be slow to speak yeah that even means like when you're in a conversation with somebody you know when you're in conf they just keep interrupting you slow to speak would mean like waiting for them to finish and some people don't finish or you're like me and you don't know how to know if they finish they pause for a second and you think they're done they weren't done quick to listen God gave you to your ears one mouth probably means we should listen more than we talk good right so so we're we're quick to listen slow to speak slow to become angry and then in Colossians chapter 4 he says let your conversation always be full of grace seasoned with salt let it be full of grace seasoned with salt okay in other words I need to work on words that are filled with grace you know what Grace is Grace is giving people what they don't deserve right amen that's good I I I I afford you what you don't deserve I'm going to take the high road I'm going to be filled with grace even when I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being treated poorly I'm going to love even when I'm hated I'm going to stay calm even when it's chaotic I'm going to stay kind-hearted when you're mean-spirited I'm going to be polite I'm going to be dignified I'm going to be SII civil I'm going to be considerate yeah that's good right there I'm going to be filled with grace okay number three write this down number three is that my mouth reveals my spiritual maturity it does if you ever want to know how spiritually mature you are pay attention to your mouth pay attention to what you say how you say it when you say it and if you even should say it it's all about the mouth I I am I spiritually mature pay attention to your mouth you know it's like when you go to the doctor and you don't feel good and the doctor says open your mouth and say ah it's the same spiritually on spiritually you can tell how sick you are by your mouth you can tell how healthy you are by your mouth because the mouth of the mature can only come from the heart of the mature see Paul said this remember this was inside of a chapter that we call the love chapter in 1 Corinthians chapter 13 Paul spends all of this chapter talking about like what Love Actually is he defines what love is love is patient love is kind right love is not self like oh look at me look at me I'm not I'm puffed up I'm building up myself so he defines what love is and then towards the end of that chapter in verse 11 in the same chapter he says when I was a child I spoke like a child I thought like a child I reasoned like a child but when I became a man I gave up childish things see there's a lot of people sitting in church every week that are growing older but they've never grown up that's good you don't miss church you come every week you're faithful to go to church you're growing older but you're not growing up he says when I was a child yeah I spoke like a child but I but I grew up I thought like a child but I grew up I reasoned I contemplated like a child but I grew up see some of us we need to grow up some people they're 50y olds trapped in a one-year-old uh body that throwing Tantrums can you imagine being born and you still look like you're one but you're 50 like you're you you know what I'm saying there's no spiritual maturity there's a lot of Binky Believers there's a lot there's a lot of Binky Believers you got to keep pacifying them pacify them pacify them pacify them pacify them pacifying feed me py what you got for me Pete I know it's going to be good today what you got for yourself man and get your face in the word of God and start growing spiritually you you do it you do it you take some ownership you start growing Binky Believers bottle Believers you still on bottles lots of different kinds of bottles in here some of you just threw down bottles in South Scott still last night and barely made it church today but we justify it don't we I curse a little but I love Jesus I drink a little but I love Jesus you didn't drink a little you're trashed we like to justify it because if we can justify it it takes away the conviction or at least masks the conviction we at least can feel better about our stupidity God doesn't want us to feel better about our stupidity he wants us to grow up in maturity to become spiritually mature to grow in our Purity to grow in our Purity than you Believers dir diapers disciples you there's a book there's a book in the Bible called Hebrews and it's not it wasn't a coffee shop so dumb and Hebrew you know what Hebrew if I could sum up Hebrews in one word you know what it is maturity yeah Hebrews is a book about growing up spiritually that's what the book is about Hebrews so I I want to read you this scripture in Hebrews 5 he says by now you should have been teacher this is for some some of you should be teachers but once again you need to be taught the simplest things about what God has said you need milk instead of solid food people who live on milk are like babies who don't really know what is right woo I don't know is that right I don't know God really say that I don't know maybe the Bible's dated I don't know I don't know I mean it says I shouldn't kill anybody but did he really mean that maybe that was for 4,000 years ago shall not murder I feel like murdering shouldn't shouldn't commit adultery why not I should have 3 four 5 6 7 8 nine 10 wives if I want it's America am I wrong no and it's in every area of our life like whatever we want to whatever we individually want to do whatever you whatever I want to do individually that's against God's word I have to make I have to justify it somehow so that I can live with myself so that I can live with myself see he say he says you you you need to grow up man you need to grow up solid food is for mature people who have been trained to know right from wrong God wants you to grow up and not be a spiritual baby but to be spiritually mature so there there's power in our words and our words reveal what's in our heart our mouths they rat us out our mouths they have the power of life and death our mouths they reveal our spiritual maturity and number four here's the last one number four is that my words they have eternal consequences not just temporal consequences Proverbs 18 says in verse 20 that you will have to live with the consequences of everything you say you will have to live with the consequences of everything you say right this is one verse before this is one verse before he says your words have the power of life and death you your your words have the power of life and death he says you will have to live with the consequences of every you guys that's frightening it's frightening because once you let those words fly you can never take them back you can't get them back you could say I'm sorry you could say forgive me you could say that was stupid of me I shouldn't have done that I shouldn't have said that I didn't mean that but they will never ever forget that they might forgive you but they won't forget it because that hurts it pierces and we've all been victims of that but we've also all been people who have used the swords on others in that very same manner so he says you're going to have to live with the consequences what you say can affect somebody positively Ney for the rest of their life not not for like now like for the rest of their life forever forever and then there are Eternal consequences we we read this earlier Jesus said in Matthew 12 he said I'm telling you that everyone that's you that's me we're going to have to give an account on the day of judgment for every empty word that we have spoken listen you tell me that's not terrifying if you believe in the same God that I believe in if you believe in the the same Bible that I believe in you are going to stand alone before God on Judgment Day and he's not going to say hey tell me about your mama's Faith hey tell me about your Grandmama's Faith he's not going to say hey hey by the way man you made a lot of money gosh Come On In no no no we're going to stand there by ourselves he doesn't care he doesn't care about he when you stand before God he he doesn't care about how much money you made on Earth he doesn't care how much you you brought in he is going to care about how much you gave away did you give your life away did you lay your life down for others because that's what love truly is did you lay it all down he he says you're going to have to give an account man for every empty word another translation says for Every Idle Word that's terrifying can you imagine like I just want to forget about the things I've said that hurt people don't you you can for for now you can try to trick yourself into forgetting about they're G he's going to ask you about it it's like here is a list of every Idol word that you've ever spoken let's talk about those you'll have to give an account see our our words are are eternal Eternal and that's why it's important that we get the monster out of our mouths now we get the monster out of our hearts now and the fact is if you want to change your mouth you've got to allow God to change your heart the good news is God changes Hearts he changes hearts and many of you are living testimonies to how God has changed your life you're here today and you say you know what I'm not who I used to be can anybody testify I'm not who I used to be Pastor tra I'm not who I used to be I can testify to the goodness of God the power of God working from the inside out thank God I'm not Hey listen I'm not everything God wants me to be but I'm not who I used to be God is changing me from the inside out I love this scripture in Ezekiel 36 he says and I will give you a new heart and I'll put a new spirit in you that's the God we serve I'm going to take out your Stony stubborn heart and give you a tender responsive heart I love that that that that he since he said some of you here today your heart's hard it you you didn't just one day go I want a hard heart life hurts experiences hardships betrayal it it made your heart hard and I can't I can't soften in a hard heart but God can God can you know when we when we have our baptism service at the 12:30 service today and and and and every you know what I love watching I love it's my favorite service of any services that we ever do is baptisms because I watch people get into a tank of water I watch it it's it's enjoyable to watch a child that's cool last month right over here there was this young man he maybe was 10 he was balling I'm telling you the power of God was sitting on this young F he was balling it made me cry it made everybody in the front row cry it was so powerful but you know what the ones that get me are the men big grown tough men they go man God has broken me and softened me and he has change my heart when I see a man get into the water and a man starts to cry I say that's the god that's the God right there that I serve That's The God Who I know changed my own life and it's the same God that can change your life would you bow your heads with me and let's close in prayer the the the Bible says this is how powerful our mouths are this is how powerful in Romans 10:9 it says if you declare with your mouth Jesus is Lord and if you believe in in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved oh I love that if you declare with your mouth he didn't say if you if you think Jesus is Lord he didn't say if you declare with your mind no he said if you declare with your mouth Jesus is Lord do I got anybody today that would say that right now Jesus is Lord I declare it out loud with my mouth Jesus is Lord Jesus is Lord Jesus you are the Lord of my life you are the master of my life you are my savior God I confess I declare with my mouth I believe it in my heart and God I pray today that you give us a new heart God that you trade that old stubborn Stony heart God with a brand new heart listen if you're here today I I I just want you to know God wants to give you a new heart he wants to put a new SP Spirit within you when you come to Jesus Christ for the for the first time when you say the Bible says any if anyone is in Christ he's a brand new creation isn't that awesome that you're a brand new cre you say Jesus today I confess I declare that you are my Lord and Savior it says that you are brand spanking new it says the old is gone the old is gone gosh praise God praise God that the old is gone the new is come God we're so grateful we're so grateful I know that there are people here today that you have been deeply hurt by words that were spoken to you I know that I know that you've been deeply wounded by something somebody has said to you it might have been when you were a little girl it might have been last week somebody has used that Venom and they they they poisoned your soul listen if you're here today I want you to know what they say Doesn't Matter What God Says is all that matters and God says in Ephesians chap 2:10 that you are his masterpiece [Music] you are his Masterpiece and so I pray that God heals your heart and heals your soul God that you mend the Brokenhearted God that you bind up our wounds God that you heal that you heal that you heal God don't let us grow bitter don't let us grow resentful but God we're going to take what was delivered to us and we're going to let it go right out of our spirits and be washed by the cleansing power of the spirit of God Almighty and we're going to focus on what you say what you say God we love you we love you we love you Jesus thank you for loving us in Jesus name we all say am amen\n</SERMON_TRANSCRIPT>\n<ideal_output>\n{\n\t\"summaryText\": \"Today we had a guest speaker James Braxton Powell deliver a sermon and it really hit home. An incredible and uplifting message about perseverance through life's fiery trials! Pastor James delivered an incredibly moving sermon about walking through difficult seasons with unwavering faith. Drawing from the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, Powell shares his own recent battle with cancer to illustrate how God doesn't just deliver us FROM fires, but walks WITH us IN them. Can you imagine being so confident in God that even if He doesn't rescue you the way you want, you'll still praise Him? That's exactly the kind of radical faith Powell challenges us to embrace! The sermon powerfully reminds us that our tests are not punishments, but purposeful processes designed to reveal God's glory. Powell's personal testimony of hearing 'you have cancer' and still declaring God's goodness is a testament to trusting God's plan even when circumstances look impossible. The most profound moment? When he shared that before his surgery, he told his wife, 'If God doesn't heal me here and now, I believe people will see my faith will not waver.' Wow!
