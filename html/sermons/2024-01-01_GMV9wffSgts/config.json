    "summaryText": "Wow, what an incredible New Year's Eve sermon from Pastor Lee McFarland! He delivered a powerful message about trusting and obeying God in 2024, using an amazing personal story about leaving his lucrative Microsoft career to follow God's calling. Pastor Lee shared how sometimes God's plan doesn't make logical sense, but when we trust and obey, incredible miracles can happen. Using the story of Naaman from 2 Kings, he illustrated how small acts of obedience can lead to massive blessings. Can you imagine walking away from a $1.3 million opportunity because God was calling you somewhere else? That's radical faith! The sermon wasn't just about making resolutions, but about positioning ourselves to hear and follow God's voice. Pastor Lee challenged us to resist getting angry when God doesn't follow our plans, to pray for discernment, and to expect God to do more than we could ever imagine. His personal testimony of launching a church that grew to 6,000 people in 10 years is a testament to what happens when we step out in faith. The key takeaway? Trust and obey - God's got you in the palm of His hand!",
