    "summaryText": "Pastor Travis Hearn delivered a powerful and deeply personal sermon about understanding the purpose of pain in our lives, diving deep into 2 Corinthians 12:7-10. Using the metaphor of a 'thorn in the flesh', PT shares five profound insights about how God uses pain: to keep us humble, to make us dependent on Him, to strengthen us, to refine us, and to prepare us for our purpose. Drawing from his own experience of a brain aneurysm and stroke, Pastor Travis vulnerably shares how even in our most broken moments, God is working to transform us. The key message? There's no pain in vain. Every challenge, every struggle has a divine purpose. Whether it's a physical ailment, emotional trauma, or personal setback, God is using these 'thorns' to shape us into His image. Pastor Travis challenges us to stop seeing our struggles as punishments and start viewing them as purposeful processes designed to reveal God's glory. The most powerful moment? When he declares that our deepest pain can become our most impactful ministry - a testimony of God's incredible grace and transformative power.",

Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.' Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong."
