    "summaryText": "Wow, what an incredible message from Pastor Travis Hearn about waiting on God's promises! Pastor Travis takes us on a powerful journey through the biblical story of Abraham and Sarah, revealing how God's promises often seem impossible, absurd, and take far longer than we expect. Can you imagine waiting 25 years for a promise to be fulfilled? PT reminds us that God's timing is perfect, and we must resist the temptation to settle, compromise, or lose hope during the waiting season. Sometimes God's best looks completely ridiculous in the natural realm - and that's exactly where faith comes in! The sermon challenges us to trust God's process, even when it doesn't make sense. Pastor Travis powerfully illustrates how compromise can have generational consequences, using the story of Ishmael as a profound example of what happens when we try to 'help' God fulfill His promises. The most powerful takeaway? God is always on time, never early, and His promises are worth waiting for. As PT says, 'Never trade a moment of pleasure for a lifetime of pain.'",
