    "summaryText": "Wow, what a powerful message from Pastor Travis Hearn about being 'stir crazy' for God! PT delivered an electrifying sermon about how Jesus enters our lives and completely disrupts our comfortable status quo. Using the triumphal entry as his backdrop, he reminded us that when Jesus shows up, everything gets stirred up! Just like an eagle stirs its nest to teach its young to fly, God sometimes creates discomfort in our lives to push us toward our destiny. Pastor Travis shared his own powerful testimony of getting radically saved after a DUI arrest, demonstrating how God can transform our lives in an instant. The most compelling part? His declaration that Impact Church exists 'so that more people will go to heaven when they die and less people will go through hell while they live.' Can you imagine the impact if we all embraced that mission? PT challenged us to get 'stir crazy' - not just for ourselves, but for the lost, the poor, and those desperately needing salvation. His passionate call to bring everyone we know to Resurrection Sunday was both a challenge and an invitation to participate in God's transformative work.",
