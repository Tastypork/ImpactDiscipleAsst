    "summaryText": "Wow, what a powerful message about breaking down the walls in our lives! Pastor Travis Hearn (PT) delivered an incredible sermon about overcoming obstacles using the incredible story of Joshua and the walls of Jericho. Drawing from Joshua chapter 6, PT reminds us that the walls that seem insurmountable are actually already defeated in God's perspective. Can you imagine standing before massive, fortified walls and being told to simply march around them and then shout? That's exactly what God instructed the Israelites to do! The sermon powerfully illustrates that our walls of shame, guilt, addiction, and fear are NOT more powerful than God's plan for our lives. PT passionately encourages us to walk by faith, not by sight, and to take bold steps even when things don't make sense. The most profound moment? When he declares that YOU are the giant, and your enemy is actually the grasshopper! This message isn't just about conquering physical walls, it's about stepping out of our comfort zones and trusting God's supernatural intervention in our lives.",

Then the Lord said to Joshua, 'See, I have delivered Jericho into your hands, along with its king and its fighting men. March around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days. Have seven priests carry trumpets of rams' horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the trumpets. When you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets, have the whole army give a loud shout; then the wall of the city will collapse and the army will go up, everyone straight in.'"

            "text": "Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. Shortly before dawn he went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. 'It's a ghost,' they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: 'Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.' 'Lord, if it's you,' Peter replied, 'tell me to come to you on the water.' 'Come,' he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, 'Lord, save me!' Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. 'You of little faith,' he said, 'why did you doubt?'"
