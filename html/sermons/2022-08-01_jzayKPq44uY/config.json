    "summaryText": "Wow, what an incredible message about stepping out in faith! Pastor Scott Williams delivered a powerful sermon on 'Walking on Water' that challenges believers to take risks and trust God in every area of life. Using the Biblical narrative of Peter walking on water, Scott breaks down how we can become 'water walkers' through a strategic approach he calls STEP: Seek God's voice, Trust God's voice, Exit the boat, and Pay close attention to Jesus. He vulnerably shares personal stories, like his childhood swimming mishap and his journey of starting a consulting company, to illustrate how stepping out in faith requires courage. The message isn't just about grand gestures, but about daily surrendering our fears and focusing on Jesus instead of our circumstances. Scott reminds us that sometimes we're not dying, we're just drowning - and God is waiting for us to trust Him and step out of our comfort zones. The sermon culminates in a powerful altar call where multiple people surrender their lives to Christ, proving that when we're willing to take risks, God shows up in miraculous ways!",

            "text": "Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. Shortly before dawn, Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. 'It's a ghost,' they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: 'Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.' 'Lord, if it's you,' Peter replied, 'tell me to come to you on the water.' 'Come,' he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, 'Lord, save me!' Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. 'You of little faith,' he said, 'why did you doubt?' And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, 'Truly you are the Son of God.'",
