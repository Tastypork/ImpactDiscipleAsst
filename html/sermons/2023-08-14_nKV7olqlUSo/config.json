    "summaryText": "Wow, what an incredible message from Pastor Travis Hearn about the power of choosing your team! PT delivered a powerful sermon that challenges us to be intentional about the people we surround ourselves with. Isn't it amazing how our friendships can literally make or break our spiritual journey? Pastor Travis breaks down the concept of 'stacking your team' with three key insights that will transform how we view relationships. Drawing from personal experiences and biblical wisdom, he reminds us that we have the incredible freedom to choose who influences our lives. The most profound moment? When he shared how changing his circle completely transformed his life - from hanging out with athletes who partied to surrounding himself with 'Bible nerds' who helped him grow spiritually. This sermon is a wake-up call to evaluate our friendships, asking ourselves: Are these people pulling me closer to God or further away? PT's passionate delivery and personal stories make this message both convicting and inspiring, reminding us that our closest relationships are perhaps the most critical decision we'll ever make for our spiritual growth.",
