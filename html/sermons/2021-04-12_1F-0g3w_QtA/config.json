    "summaryText": "Wow, what an incredibly powerful message from Montell Jordan about developing the heart of a servant! In this transformative sermon, Pastor Montell breaks down what it truly means to build on your salvation by embracing humility and serving others. Drawing from his own life experiences in the music industry, he vulnerably shares how God had to humble him, stripping away fame and fortune to help him understand true significance. Can you imagine a multi-platinum R&B artist changing diapers in children's ministry? That's exactly what Montell and his wife did as part of their journey of humility! The core message is simple yet profound: to be like Jesus, we must become servants who prioritize others over ourselves. Whether it's serving your family, workplace, community, or church, the key is approaching every role with humility. Montell challenges us to look beyond worldly success and instead focus on how we can uplift and support those around us. He reminds us that we didn't pay for ourselves - we belong to God - and our ultimate purpose is to reflect Christ's servant heart in everything we do. The most powerful moment? When he shares that for some people, we might be the only representation of Jesus they ever see. Talk about a challenging and inspiring call to action!",

But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. All of us, then, who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you. Only let us live up to what we have already attained."

And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death\u2014even death on a cross! Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
