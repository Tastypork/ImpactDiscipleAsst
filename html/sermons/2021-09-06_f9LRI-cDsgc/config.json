    "summaryText": "What an incredible message from Pastor Travis Hearn about making room for Jesus and using our influence for God's Kingdom! In this powerful sermon from Mark chapter 2, PT walks us through the incredible story of four friends who were so committed to bringing their paralyzed friend to Jesus that they literally dug through a roof. Can you imagine that level of determination? The sermon challenges us to ask: Are we making room for Jesus in every area of our lives? Pastor Travis breaks down three key lessons from these men: compassion, commitment, and courage. He reminds us that we ALL have influence - whether we realize it or not. Just like salt seasons food and light illuminates darkness, we are called to season and shine in our world. The most powerful moment? When he shared how one social media post by a Phoenix Suns player led to multiple people giving their lives to Christ - including the Diamondbacks mascot! Pastor Travis's message is clear: Your influence matters, and God wants to use YOU to impact others for His Kingdom.",

They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left, even outside the door, and he preached the word to them. Some men came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, carried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, 'Son, your sins are forgiven.'",
