    "summaryText": "Wow, what a powerful message about relationships and stopping the 'leaks' in our lives! Pastor Darrison Tellez delivered an incredible sermon that cuts right to the heart of why our relationships - and our spiritual lives - often feel dry and unsatisfying. Can you imagine viewing your relationships like a bucket with holes? PT breaks down three major ways we create 'leaks': comparison, compromise, and a false sense of completeness. I love how he challenges us to stop looking sideways at others and start looking upward to God! The sermon powerfully reminds us that true fulfillment comes not from comparing ourselves to others or settling for less than God's best, but from keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus. Whether you're single, married, or somewhere in between, this message is a game-changer. Pastor Darrison helps us understand that our relationships aren't just about finding the right person, but about becoming the right person God wants us to be. The most profound moment? When he reminds us that Jesus was single at 33 and completely whole - proving that completeness comes from God alone, not from another person. This sermon is a wake-up call to stop living a 'leaky' life and start living an overflowing one!",
