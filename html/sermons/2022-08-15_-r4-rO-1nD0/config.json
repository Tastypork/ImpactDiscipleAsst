    "summaryText": "What an incredible message from Pastor Travis Hearn about feeling overlooked and unseen! Pastor Travis dives deep into the biblical narrative of David, showing us that even when people dismiss us, God sees our true potential. He powerfully reminds us that God specializes in using the least likely people to accomplish extraordinary things. Sometimes we feel forgotten, passed over, or undervalued, but PT wants us to know that God's perspective is completely different from the world's. He sees your heart, your potential, and your purpose - even when no one else does! Drawing from stories like David and Gideon, Pastor Travis emphasizes that God looks beyond external appearances and sees the inner potential waiting to be unleashed. The most powerful moment? When he declares that what the enemy meant for evil, God will use for good. If you've ever felt like you're not enough, this sermon is a reminder that you are God's first pick, not the world's last choice. God is strategically positioning you, protecting you, and preparing you for something greater than you can imagine!",
