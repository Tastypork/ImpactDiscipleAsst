    "summaryText": "Wow, what an incredible sermon from Pastor Travis Hearn about being stuck between the word and the world! Pastor Travis delivered a powerful message challenging believers to stop living with divided loyalties and fully commit to God's path. Drawing from the book of James, he passionately explained how trying to straddle both God's ways and worldly desires leads to an unsettled and unstable life. I love how he used the vivid monkey trap illustration - sometimes we're so attached to our 'fruit' that we can't let go, even when it's trapping us! The sermon was a wake-up call, reminding us that God is calling us UP, not just calling us OUT. Pastor Travis challenged us to surrender our will, take up our cross, and truly follow Jesus, even when it means cutting out things that are holding us back. His personal story about his mother's sacrificial love was particularly touching, showing how surrendering our will can look in real life. The core message? You can't experience God's favor while simultaneously feeding your flesh. It's time to soar like an eagle, not settle like a chicken in the coop!",
