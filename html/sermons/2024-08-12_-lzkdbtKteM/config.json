    "summaryText": "Wow, what an incredible message about personal transformation from Pastor Travis Hearn! In this powerful sermon, PT dives deep into the profound truth that when we encounter Jesus, we are completely made new. He walks us through what it truly means to say 'I'm not who I used to be' by exploring four incredible ways God transforms us: giving us a new creation, a new heart, a new mind, and new eyes. Pastor Travis shares from personal experience how God can radically change a person's entire trajectory, using the apostle Paul's dramatic conversion as a powerful example. He challenges us to embrace that transformation is a process - we won't be perfect overnight, but God is faithfully working in us, removing our hard, deceived, and broken hearts, and replacing them with hearts of flesh that can truly see and understand His love. The sermon is a beautiful reminder that no matter our past, God's grace is bigger, His love is deeper, and His power to transform is absolutely unmatched. Can you imagine a God so powerful that He can take a persecutor of Christians and turn him into one of the greatest church planters in history? That's the same God working in us today!",
