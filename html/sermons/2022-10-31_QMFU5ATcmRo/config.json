    "summaryText": "Wow, what a powerful message from Pastor Travis Hearn about not being a 'bougie believer'! PT breaks down how many Christians approach faith with convenience and selfishness instead of true servanthood. He challenges us to stop being consumers and start being contributors in God's kingdom. The sermon hits hard with practical ways to live out our faith: serving selflessly, giving generously, and living sacrificially. Pastor Travis uses humor and real-life stories to drive home the point that true joy comes from giving, not getting. Can you imagine how different our churches and communities would look if we all took this message to heart? He reminds us that Jesus didn't come to be served, but to serve - and we're called to do the same. The most eye-opening moment? When he reveals that if 100% of Impact Church members tithed for just 12 months, they could build a $100 million arena in cash! This isn't just about money, it's about transforming our hearts from self-centered to Christ-centered.",
