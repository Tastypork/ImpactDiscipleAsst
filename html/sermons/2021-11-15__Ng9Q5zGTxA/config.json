    "summaryText": "Pastor Travis Hearn delivers a powerful sermon on the fight for peace in our relationships, diving deep into the spiritual warfare that often undermines our harmony. Using musical metaphors and keyboard demonstrations, PT illustrates how relationships should sound like beautiful, harmonious chords, but often end up as discordant, chaotic noise. The key message? Don't fight the person, fight the problem. Our real enemy isn't each other, but the spiritual forces working to divide us. Pastor Travis challenges us to be peacemakers, not just peaceful people, highlighting that true peace requires active effort, especially when tensions are high. He reveals that our greatest battles happen in our minds, and we must guard our hearts and mouths carefully. The sermon is a compelling call to rise above conflict, choose righteousness over being right, and allow God's spirit to transform our relationships from the inside out.",

All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and sea creatures are being tamed and have been tamed by mankind, but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
