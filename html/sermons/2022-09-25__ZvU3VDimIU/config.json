    "summaryText": "Wow, what a powerful sermon about spiritual growth! Pastor Travis Hearn delivered an incredible message about 'Addition by Subtraction' that challenges us to intentionally remove things from our lives to make room for God. PT powerfully illustrates how we often think adding more will improve our lives, but God's economy works differently - less is truly more! Drawing from personal experience and Biblical wisdom, he breaks down two critical areas we need to 'detoxify': our thought life and our friend circle. Can you imagine how transformative it would be to carefully curate what enters your mind and who influences your spiritual journey? Pastor Travis shares his own story of radical transformation after becoming a Christian, demonstrating how choosing the right influences can completely reshape your life. The most compelling part? He challenges us to run our spiritual race with people who are on the 'same race, same pace' - committed to pursuing Christ wholeheartedly. This sermon isn't just a message, it's a blueprint for spiritual maturity!",
