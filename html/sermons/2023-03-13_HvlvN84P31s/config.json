    "summaryText": "Wow, what an incredible message from Pastor Scott Williams about the power of listening! In this powerful sermon, Pastor Scott breaks down the art of truly hearing from God using the story of Peter's miraculous fishing encounter with Jesus. He challenges us to listen with our eyes, ears, and heart - not just hearing, but truly understanding God's direction. Pastor Scott hilariously calls out some modern distractions like horoscopes and Instagram influencers, reminding us that only God's voice matters. The sermon's core message? You've got to be willing to dig deep and go beyond the surface level in your relationship with God. I love how he uses the metaphor of fishing nets representing our comfort zones - sometimes we need to cast our nets into deeper waters to experience God's miraculous provision! Whether you're struggling with insecurity, facing a tough diagnosis, or just feeling stuck, Pastor Scott's message is clear: listen carefully, trust completely, and be ready to follow Jesus's unexpected instructions. His illustration of the stethoscope - connecting eyes, ears, and heart - was particularly powerful, reminding us that hearing God is about total alignment, not just partial attention.",

He saw at the water's edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets. He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat. When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, 'Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.' Simon answered, 'Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.' When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.",
