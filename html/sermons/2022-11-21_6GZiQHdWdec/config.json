    "summaryText": "What an incredible message from Pastor Chris Durso about experiencing God's miracles! This sermon was a powerful reminder that faith isn't about explaining everything, but about believing what we've seen God do. Pastor Chris shared a deeply personal story about his son Dylan's miraculous healing from a rare blood disease, demonstrating that God shows up in unexpected ways. The core message? Don't let anyone diminish your miracle or experience with God! Sometimes people want logical explanations, but our God doesn't need to be explained - He just needs to be experienced. Pastor Chris challenges us to boldly declare 'I'm the man/woman' when it comes to God's transformative power in our lives. Whether it's healing, marriage restoration, or overcoming addiction, God is in the business of doing the impossible. The most powerful line? 'Your story, my glory' - meaning God uses our experiences to showcase His incredible love and power. If you've experienced a miracle, don't be silent! Share it, celebrate it, and let others see how good God truly is.",
