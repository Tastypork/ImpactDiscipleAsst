    "summaryText": "Wow, what a powerful message about total surrender from Pastor Travis Hearn! PT delivered an incredible sermon about being a 'conditional use Christian' versus an all-in, no-strings-attached follower of Jesus. He challenges us to ask ourselves: Are we really willing to say 'yes' to God without limitations? The sermon dives deep into what it truly means to follow Christ - it's not about joining a comfortable club, but about being willing to go wherever God calls you. Pastor Travis shares his own spiritual journey, revealing how 31 years ago he prayed a dangerous prayer: 'God, use me however, whenever, wherever.' He candidly shares that this prayer led him through incredible mountaintops and devastating valleys, but ultimately transformed his life. The most powerful moment? When he reveals that most Christians want Jesus to follow them, instead of them following Jesus. This sermon is a wake-up call to stop playing church and start being a true disciple - someone who says 'yes' to God before He even asks the question!",
