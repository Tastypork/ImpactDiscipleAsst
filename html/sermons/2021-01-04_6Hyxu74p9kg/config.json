    "summaryText": "Wow, what a powerful New Year's sermon from Pastor Travis Hearn about throwing away things that hinder our spiritual growth! In this transformative message, PT breaks down four key areas we need to 'throw away' in 2021: insecurities, critical spirits, temper/anger, and toxic relationships. It's like a spiritual cleaning out of our emotional and relational closets! Pastor Travis reminds us that we are 'good enough' just as God created us, and challenges us to stop being our own worst critics. One of the most powerful moments was when he emphasized that insecurity is actually selfish - life isn't about us, it's about what God wants to do through us. He brilliantly unpacks how our critical spirits, anger, and toxic relationships can sabotage our spiritual journey, using humor and real-life examples that make the message both convicting and accessible. The overarching theme? Growth isn't about getting older, it's about becoming more like Christ. Pastor Travis invites us to start 2021 with a fresh perspective: throw away what's holding you back and embrace who God says you are!",
