    "summaryText": "Wow, what an incredible message from Pastor Darrison Tellez about waiting and perseverance! The sermon on Hannah's story in 1 Samuel was a powerful reminder that just because something is 'closed' doesn't mean it's 'cancelled'. Pastor Darrison beautifully unpacked how our seasons of waiting aren't punishment, but preparation. Can you imagine being so desperate for God's promise that you'd keep praying even when everyone thinks you look crazy? Hannah's story reminds us that faithfulness often looks like foolishness to the world! Pastor shared a personal story about his daughter's desperate pursuit of her 'boyfriend' to illustrate how true desperation can keep us focused. The key takeaway? God might close doors temporarily, but He never cancels His plans for you. When you're at your breaking point, you're closest to your breakthrough! Sometimes God has to press you to reveal the most authentic version of yourself. Just like Hannah, who kept pushing in prayer until God not only gave her Samuel but used him to select King David - which ultimately led to Jesus' lineage. Isn't it amazing how God can use our seemingly impossible situations to create generational impact?",
