    "summaryText": "What an incredible message about hope during seasons of drought! Pastor Darrison Tellez delivered a powerful sermon that reminds us God is always working, even when we can't see it. Drawing from the story of Elijah praying for rain in 1 Kings 18, PT explores how those 'nothing' moments aren't actually nothing - they're preparation! Sometimes God delays His assistance not because He's neglecting us, but because He's developing something far greater. Can you imagine waiting six times and seeing absolutely nothing, and then suddenly on the seventh time, a tiny cloud appears? That's exactly what happened with Elijah, and it's a powerful metaphor for our own spiritual journeys. Pastor Darrison challenges us to stop despising small beginnings and recognize that God rejoices to see the work start. Whether you're in a season of waiting, feeling overlooked, or wondering if God has forgotten you, this message is a reminder that what looks like 'nothing' might actually be God's most significant preparation yet. The miracle always starts with the small thing we have in our hand!",
