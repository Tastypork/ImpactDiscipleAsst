    "summaryText": "Wow, what a powerful sermon about love and selflessness from Pastor Travis Hearn! In today's message, PT breaks down what true love really looks like - and spoiler alert, it's not about us! Can you imagine a world where everyone prioritized others before themselves? Pastor Travis digs deep into 1 Corinthians 13, revealing that love is fundamentally about surrender, service, and sacrifice. He challenges us to move beyond our narcissistic, self-absorbed nature and embrace a Christ-like selflessness. Using powerful illustrations like Mary's extravagant act of pouring expensive perfume on Jesus' feet versus Judas' selfish critique, PT shows us the difference between givers and takers. The most profound moment? When he reminds us that true love looks like Jesus - willing to be crucified for others. This isn't just a feel-good message; it's a radical call to transform how we approach relationships, ministry, and our entire life's purpose. Pastor Travis isn't just preaching - he's inviting us into a completely different way of living that puts others first and trusts God with everything.",
