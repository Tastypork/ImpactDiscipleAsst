    "summaryText": "Wow, what an incredible message from Pastor Travis Hearn about feeling overlooked! Sometimes in life, we feel invisible, like God doesn't see us or our struggles. PT brilliantly breaks down what to do when you feel hidden or forgotten. He shares a powerful personal story about being the last picked at 'Chicken Park' and transforms that painful memory into a profound spiritual lesson. The sermon's core message? God isn't ignoring you - He's PREPARING you! Just like David was overlooked by his own family but hand-picked by God, you might be in a season of preparation, not punishment. Pastor Travis provides four incredible strategies for those feeling unseen: grow your character, sharpen your skills, develop a fruitful network, and most importantly, continue growing your relationship with God. The most transformative moment? When he reminds us that true living comes from GIVING, not getting. Whether you're feeling overlooked in your career, relationships, or spiritual journey, this sermon is a lifeline of hope and divine strategy!",
