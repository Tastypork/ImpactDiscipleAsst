    "summaryText": "Wow, what a powerful message about proximity! Pastor Scott Williams delivers an incredible sermon that challenges us to get closer to Jesus by being in the right proximity - to people, places, and things. Drawing from the story in Mark 2 about the paralyzed man, Scott shares how four friends' determination to get their friend to Jesus can teach us powerful life lessons. He emphasizes that who you surround yourself with matters tremendously, using a powerful personal story about an inmate named Lou who transformed his life by changing his circle. The sermon isn't just a message, it's a call to action - to dig through obstacles, to keep pursuing Jesus, and to position yourself strategically for breakthrough. Scott's personal experiences, from being a prison warden to his work on the pardon and parole board, provide raw, authentic insights into how proximity can change everything. The most powerful moment? When he challenges everyone to get close to the 'things of Jesus' - serving, giving, and pursuing God with intentionality. This message is a game-changer for anyone feeling stuck or wanting to see real transformation in their life.",

They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them. Some men came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, carried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on.",
