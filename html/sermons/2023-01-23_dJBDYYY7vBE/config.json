    "summaryText": "Today, Pastor Davide Mutendji delivered an incredible message about reclaiming our sense of 'wonder' in life! Using the famous biblical story of Peter walking on water, he challenged us to stop limiting our faith by our fears and circumstances. Can you imagine being so focused on the waves that you miss Jesus literally walking right beside you? Pastor Davide brilliantly unpacked how we often get stuck in 'weary wondering', 'worried wondering', and 'wasted wondering' instead of believing in what God can do. The most powerful moment was when he highlighted that Peter's miracle wasn't about being special, but about being willing to ask - 'Lord, if it's you, tell me to come.' Isn't that profound? It's not about having superhuman faith, but about having the courage to ask and step out. Pastor Davide reminded us that this year isn't about getting new things, but about getting new thoughts. He challenged us to shift our perspective and believe that if God calls us, He will enable us. The message was a powerful call to reclaim our wonder, to stop letting fear paralyze us, and to believe that with God, anything is possible!",
