    "summaryText": "Wow, what an incredible message from Pastor Manny Arango about resilience, faith, and believing again after failure! Pastor Manny shared his deeply personal journey of struggling with infertility, experiencing a devastating miscarriage, and ultimately receiving a miracle child through perseverance and faith. Drawing from the biblical story of Peter walking on water, he powerfully illustrated that faith isn't just about initial courage, but about having the strength to get back up after sinking. Sometimes life throws us unexpected challenges that can make us want to retreat, but Pastor Manny reminds us that God is calling us to 'have faith again' - to trust, hope, and step out even after experiencing pain. His own testimony of going through IVF twice, losing a pregnancy during the pandemic, and ultimately receiving a miracle son is a testament to God's faithfulness. The most powerful moment? When he described his wife's perspective of being grateful for the nine weeks of pregnancy, showing that our attitude can transform our experience of setbacks. Pastor Manny's message isn't just about miraculous moments, but about the courage to believe and trust God's plan, even when it doesn't look like what we expected.",

            "text": "Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. 'It's a ghost,' they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: 'Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.' 'Lord, if it's you,' Peter replied, 'tell me to come to you on the water.' 'Come,' he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, 'Lord, save me!' Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. 'You of little faith,' he said, 'why did you doubt?'",
