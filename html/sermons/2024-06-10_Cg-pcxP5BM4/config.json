    "summaryText": "What an incredible message from Pastor James Braxton Powell about facing our issues head-on with God's power! Powell shared a deeply personal sermon about wrestling with life's challenges and staying close to Jesus, using the powerful story of Jairus and the woman with the issue of blood from Mark chapter 5. Can you imagine being so desperate for healing that you'd crawl through a crowd just to touch Jesus' garment? Powell reminds us that 'crawling counts in the kingdom of God' - meaning even when we feel weak, our faith can still move mountains! He vulnerably shared his own struggles, including his son being bullied and his past trauma, demonstrating that God isn't scared of our 'uncleanness'. The most powerful moment was when Powell declared that whatever the enemy has fought against you, God has a greater purpose. He challenged the church to wake up, rise up, and recognize that greater is He that is in us than he that is in the world. The sermon was a rallying cry for believers to stop living defeated and start walking in divine purpose, no matter what issues we're facing.",
