    "summaryText": "Wow, what an incredible message from Pastor Travis Hearn about feeling overlooked! PT delivered a powerful sermon that speaks directly to anyone who has ever felt passed over, unseen, or forgotten. Using the story of David, he reminds us that just because we're overlooked by people doesn't mean we're overlooked by God. Sometimes, what feels like rejection is actually God's protection and preparation for something extraordinary! The most profound takeaway? God is hiding you, not to punish you, but to position you for something amazing. Pastor Travis shared personal stories that made the message feel so relatable - from being the last kid picked in basketball to struggling with his own calling. The sermon is a beautiful reminder that your time is coming, and God sees you even when others don't. He challenged us to keep growing in character, keep developing our skills, and keep our focus on God instead of comparing ourselves to others. If you've ever felt overlooked, this message is a powerful reminder: You are chosen, you are seen, and your time is coming!",
