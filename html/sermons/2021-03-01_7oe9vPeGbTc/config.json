    "summaryText": "Wow, what a powerful message about fresh starts from Pastor Todd Boffo! Today's sermon was all about how God sees us not just where we are, but where we could be. Pastor Todd used the story of Peter to illustrate how God can transform our lives in an instant, no matter our past mistakes. Can you imagine being so broken and yet so loved that Jesus still chooses you to build His church? That's exactly what happened with Peter - a brash fisherman who became a foundational apostle! Todd beautifully explained that our failures are not final, and God is always ready to give us a new beginning. He shared a compelling illustration about a Picasso painting that was damaged but restored to an even higher value, just like how God can restore and elevate our lives. The key takeaway? God doesn't look at you through the lens of your worst mistake - He's pulling you toward an incredible future! Some of you might feel like a small pebble, but God sees you as a rock upon which He can build something extraordinary. This sermon is a powerful reminder that it's never too late to start over, and God is always ready to walk with you into a new season.",
