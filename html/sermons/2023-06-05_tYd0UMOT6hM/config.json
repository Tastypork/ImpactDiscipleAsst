    "summaryText": "Wow, what a powerful message from Pastor Scott Williams about moving from midnight to daylight! He walked us through Acts 16, sharing an incredible journey of how Paul and Silas transformed a potentially devastating situation into a miraculous moment of breakthrough. Can you imagine being thrown into prison and instead of complaining, you're worshiping God? That's exactly what these disciples did! Pastor Scott broke down three critical steps for navigating life's challenging seasons: call out evil, call down heaven, and call up others. He powerfully reminded us that just because we're in a 'midnight moment' doesn't mean we're stuck there - God is always working to bring us to daylight. The most incredible part? Their worship in prison not only freed them physically but led an entire household to salvation! Sometimes our most challenging moments are actually setups for God's greatest miracles. Scott's message wasn't just a sermon; it was a roadmap for turning adversity into opportunity, reminding us that our response to difficulty determines our destiny.",

She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling. She followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, 'These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved.' She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so annoyed that he turned and said to the spirit, 'In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!' At that moment the spirit left her.",
