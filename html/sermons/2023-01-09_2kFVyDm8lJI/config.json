    "summaryText": "Wow, what an incredible message about rebuilding our lives in 2023! Pastor Tommy 'Urban D' Kyllonen delivered a powerful sermon from the book of Nehemiah, challenging Impact Church to embrace a year of transformation. Drawing from Nehemiah's story, he shared five 'rebuilding block prayers' that can radically change our approach to life: developing compassion, admitting when we're wrong, allowing God to break and remake us, listening to divine instructions, and following through with courage. The most inspiring part? The real-life stories of compassion, like Travis's viral social media ministry helping people in need. Pastor Tommy reminded us that God doesn't call the qualified, He qualifies the called! His spoken word piece about 'reframing' our perspective was particularly powerful, showing how changing our mental frames can totally transform our outlook. The sermon was a bold invitation to step out in faith, believe God's promises, and watch Him do miraculous things in our lives. As Pastor Tommy said, 'I dare you to do what God is calling you to do in this new year!'",
