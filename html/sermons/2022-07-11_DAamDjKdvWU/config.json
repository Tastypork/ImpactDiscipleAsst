    "summaryText": "Wow, what a powerful message from Montell and Kristin Jordan about transforming marriage from 'me' to 'we'! In this incredible sermon, they break down the journey of creating a godly, covenant marriage through five transformative stops: submission, sequence, being sold out, sacrifice, and service. Isn't it amazing how they challenge our cultural norms and invite us to see marriage as a divine partnership? Pastor Montell hilariously demonstrates this with a toilet seat illustration that had the whole congregation laughing while learning a profound lesson about prioritizing your spouse. The Jordans aren't just talking theory - they're sharing from decades of real-life experience, showing how choosing marriage over individual desires can create something miraculous. The core message? Marriage isn't about losing yourself, but about upgrading your identity through Christ-centered love. They powerfully remind us that only God can truly complete us, and when two people bring their 'whole 110%' to a relationship, something supernatural happens!",
