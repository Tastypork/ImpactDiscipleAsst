    "summaryText": "What a powerful message from Pastor Chris Durso about surrender and being available for God's purpose! Chris walks us through the story of Mary, highlighting how a simple 14-year-old girl changed the course of human history by saying 'let it happen' to God's plan. Isn't that incredible? Sometimes we get so caught up in our own fears and limitations that we miss the amazing assignments God has for us. Pastor Chris breaks down how God wants to use EVERYONE, regardless of age, background, or perceived ability. He reminds us that we've been given gifts, but we are NOT the gift - we're simply the vessel. The most profound moment was when he explained that every spiritual gift is designed to serve OTHERS, not ourselves. Can you imagine a world where Christians understood this principle? Each of us has a unique calling, and God is just waiting for us to say 'yes' to His plan. Whether you're scared of your assignment or excited about it, the key is surrender. As Chris powerfully stated, 'It's not up to you to complete it on your own - the Holy Spirit is on you!'",
