    "summaryText": "Wow, what a powerful message of healing and wholeness from Pastor Montell Jordan! Isn't it amazing how God doesn't just want to heal us, but make us completely whole? Using the powerful story of the ten lepers in Luke 17, Pastor Jordan breaks down three incredible insights about healing. Sometimes we have to go THROUGH our challenges, not around them. God sees us - even when we feel distant and forgotten. And most importantly, healing requires movement and action on our part! The most profound moment was when he highlighted that out of ten lepers healed, only one returned to thank Jesus - and THAT is what made him whole. Can you imagine? Physical healing is one thing, but being truly whole is transformative! Pastor Montell shared his own vulnerable journey of healing after infidelity, demonstrating that no matter how broken we are, God can restore and make us completely new. The sermon wasn't just about physical healing, but healing of the heart, mind, and spirit. Whether you're struggling with hidden sin, unforgiveness, or feeling stuck, this message declares that healing is on the way - but you've got to be willing to move and have faith!",

They stood at a distance and called out in a loud voice, 'Jesus, Master, have pity on us!' When he saw them, he said, 'Go, show yourselves to the priests.' And as they went, they were cleansed. One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. He threw himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him\u2014and he was a Samaritan. Jesus asked, 'Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?' Then he said to him, 'Rise and go; your faith has made you well.'",
