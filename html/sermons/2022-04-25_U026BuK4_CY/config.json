    "summaryText": "In this powerful message about walking under the influence of the Holy Spirit, Scott Williams delivers an incredible sermon that challenges believers to live differently! Using the analogy of air traffic control guiding a plane safely, Pastor Scott illustrates how the Holy Spirit wants to guide us through life's turbulent moments. Drawing from Galatians 5, he breaks down what it means to truly be 'under the influence' of the Spirit using the memorable acronym WALK: Walk Different, Act Different, Live Different, and Know Different. Just like getting drunk takes repeated drinking, walking in the Spirit requires consistent spiritual 'intake'. Pastor Scott reminds us that the Holy Spirit isn't some mystical force, but a loving guide wanting to help us navigate life's challenges safely. The message culminates in a powerful altar call where multiple people surrender their lives to Christ, proving that when we tune into the Holy Spirit's frequency, transformative moments can happen! The key takeaway? It's not about being perfect, but being intentional about listening and responding to God's gentle nudges.",

            "text": "So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit."
