    "summaryText": "Wow, what a powerful message from Pastor Leo Bigger about miracles and faith! In this incredible sermon, Pastor Leo takes us on a journey through the story of Lazarus, revealing how miracles happen in our lives. He challenges us to maintain faith even when situations look impossible, using the powerful 'even though' perspective. Pastor Leo shares a personal story about his own son, demonstrating how God can resurrect dreams and turn seemingly dead situations into incredible testimonies. The message is clear: never give up! God can speak one word and completely transform your circumstances. Sometimes miracles come immediately, sometimes through a process, but God is always working. The most profound moment? When Pastor Leo encourages us that our hope should be in a PERSON (Jesus) rather than a RESULT. Can you imagine having faith so strong that even when nothing seems to be changing, you still trust God? That's the kind of radical faith Pastor Leo is calling us to embrace!",

The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, 'This is what the Lord says: Put your house in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover.' Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord, 'Remember, Lord, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes.' And Hezekiah wept bitterly. Before Isaiah had left the middle court, the word of the Lord came to him: 'Go back and tell Hezekiah, the ruler of my people, 'This is what the Lord, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will heal you.'"
