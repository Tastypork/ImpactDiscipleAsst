    "summaryText": "What an incredible message about overcoming worry from Pastor Leo Bigger! Drawing from the story of the disciples on the road to Emmaus, he delivered a powerful sermon about how God is always with us, even when we can't recognize His presence. Pastor Leo brilliantly explained how worry is like a chain reaction, starting small and snowballing into massive fears that paralyze us. Using neuroscience and biblical wisdom, he illustrated how our brain's amygdala (emotional center) often battles with our prefrontal cortex (logical center), creating internal conflict. The most profound moment was when he shared a testimony of a woman healed after taking communion daily, demonstrating that when we sit down and surrender, miracles can happen! Pastor Leo's message was a beautiful reminder that whatever is falling apart in our lives, Jesus is sitting at our table, ready to restore and heal. His advice? Don't worry, instead sit down, listen to God, and remember - your story isn't over yet!",
