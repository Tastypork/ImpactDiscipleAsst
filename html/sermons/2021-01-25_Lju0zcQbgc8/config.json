    "summaryText": "What a powerful message about God's presence in our valleys! Pastor Travis Hearn delivers an incredibly encouraging sermon about navigating life's challenging seasons. Sometimes we think God only shows up on the mountaintops, but PT reminds us that He is just as present - and powerful - in our deepest valleys. Drawing from Psalm 23, he reveals four incredible insights about God's work during our most difficult times: God is growing us, defending us, anointing us, and setting us up for blessing. Can you imagine that the very challenges trying to break you are actually God's method of preparing you for something amazing? PT shares that our greatest ministries are often birthed from our greatest miseries. The sermon powerfully reminds us that no matter what valley you're walking through right now, God is not just with you, but He is actively working on your behalf. What the enemy means for destruction, God will use for your development and destiny!",
