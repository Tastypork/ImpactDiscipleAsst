    "summaryText": "Wow, what a powerful message from Pastor Travis Hearn about spiritual growth and maturity! In this incredible sermon, Pastor Travis challenges us to recognize when we've outgrown certain mindsets, behaviors, and ways of speaking. Drawing from the story in Second Kings about a lost axhead, he powerfully illustrates how God cares about even the smallest details of our lives. Pastor Travis emphasizes that growth isn't automatic - it requires intentionality, effort, and a willingness to leave behind childish ways. The most striking point? Our words and thoughts are interconnected, and they reveal our spiritual maturity. Can you imagine how transformative it would be if we consciously chose to speak life, encouragement, and love? Pastor Travis reminds us that we have the power to control the 'seeds' we plant in our minds, which ultimately become the 'fruit' of our words. This sermon is a wake-up call to stop being spiritual babies and start growing up in Christ, leaving behind negative thinking, gossip, and immature communication. The challenge is clear: it's time to outgrow that small, limited mindset and embrace the expansive, transformative life God has prepared for us!",
