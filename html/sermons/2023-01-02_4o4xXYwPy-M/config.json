    "summaryText": "In this powerful New Year's sermon, Pastor Chris Durso delivers a transformative message about being a student of God's word versus being a spiritual 'scavenger'. Isn't it incredible how we often settle for secondhand spiritual experiences when God is inviting us into direct relationship? Chris breaks down the difference between those who merely collect spiritual soundbites and those who truly study and apply God's word. He challenges us to become intentional students who not only read the Bible but allow the Bible to read us! The sermon powerfully illustrates how knowing Scripture intimately can help us stand firm during life's storms, just like Jesus did when confronted by Satan's temptations. Pastor Chris uses his personal story of overcoming a learning disability to demonstrate how God can use anyone who commits to studying His word. The message is a rallying cry for believers to stop being passive consumers of Christianity and start actively engaging with God's transformative truth.",
