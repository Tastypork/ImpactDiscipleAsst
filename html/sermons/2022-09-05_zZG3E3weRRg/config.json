    "summaryText": "What an incredible sermon by Pastor Travis Hearn about stepping out of our comfort zones! Pastor Travis breaks down the powerful story of Peter walking on water with Jesus, challenging us to move beyond what feels safe and familiar. Isn't it so true that we often get stuck in our 'boats' of comfort, afraid to take that step of faith? PT reminds us that our miracles are waiting on the other side of our courage! Drawing from biblical stories like Jonah running from God and Jacob and Esau's birthright narrative, he powerfully illustrates how comfort can cost us our divine calling. The most convicting moment? When he references Revelation 3 and talks about being 'lukewarm' - neither hot nor cold - and how God desires our complete surrender. Pastor Travis challenges us to go 'all in' for Jesus, not just showing up occasionally, but fully committing to our relationship with God. It's like he's saying, 'Your comfort zone is the enemy of your calling!' This message isn't just a sermon, it's a wake-up call to step out of our boats, trust God, and experience the supernatural miraculous power He has waiting for us.",
