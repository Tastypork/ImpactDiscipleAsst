    "summaryText": "Wow, what a powerful message from Pastor Tyshone Roland about waiting on God's promises! Isn't it incredible how God works in our timing, not just our own? Drawing from Hannah's story in 1 Samuel, Tyshone shares a deeply personal and inspiring message about holding onto hope even when circumstances seem impossible. He vulnerably shares his own journey of waiting, including losing family members and holding onto prophetic words that seemed delayed. The sermon is a beautiful reminder that God's 'due season' isn't always when we expect it, but it's always perfect. Sometimes all we have is a word, a promise, and the faith to keep believing. Pastor Tyshone challenges us to keep praying, even when we're bitter, to give God glory in all seasons, and to worship Him regardless of our current circumstances. His personal testimony of receiving a prophetic word at 20 and seeing it fulfilled years later is a powerful testament to God's faithfulness. The message resonates with anyone who has ever felt stuck waiting for a promise, offering hope and encouragement that God is working behind the scenes, even when we can't see it.",
