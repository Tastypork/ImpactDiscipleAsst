    "summaryText": "What a powerful sermon from Pastor Jabin Chavez about moving forward and embracing God's new things! Pastor Chavez challenges us to break free from the limitations of our past and step boldly into God's incredible future. Drawing from Isaiah 43, he reminds us that God is constantly doing something new - but we often miss it by dwelling on what was instead of what could be. Can you imagine how many blessings we might be blocking by constantly looking backward? Pastor Chavez shares personal stories that illustrate how our past experiences, both good and bad, can become barriers to God's remarkable plans. He emphasizes that God is more interested in new beginnings than second chances, and He's always ready to do something unprecedented in our lives. The most striking point? God is bigger than our missed opportunities, our mistakes, and our limitations. Whether you're feeling stuck in past failures or past successes, this message is a powerful reminder that God is saying, 'Behold, I am doing a new thing!' The invitation is clear: forget what lies behind, embrace the present, and see the future God is preparing.",
