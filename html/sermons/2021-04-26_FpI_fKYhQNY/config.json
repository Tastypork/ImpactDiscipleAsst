    "summaryText": "What an incredible sermon on stepping out of our comfort zones and walking by faith! Pastor Travis Hearn delivered a powerful message about getting out of the boat - not just any boat, but the boat of fear, complacency, and doubt that keeps us from experiencing God's supernatural miracles. Drawing from the biblical story of Peter walking on water, PT challenges us to examine what boats we're currently sitting in. Are we stuck in boats of resentment, anger, guilt, or missed opportunities? The sermon powerfully reminds us that faith doesn't make logical sense - and that's exactly the point! God wants us to trust Him beyond our human understanding. Pastor Travis shares his own journey of stepping out in faith, leaving his previous church position without knowing exactly what was next, demonstrating that true faith means taking one step at a time and watching God provide. The most memorable line? 'If you want to see what God is capable of doing in your life, you're going to have to step out of the boat.' Isn't that just so true? We often limit ourselves by staying in our comfort zones, but God is calling us to something greater - to walk by faith and not by sight, trusting that He will guide our every step.",

            "text": "Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. 'It's a ghost,' they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: 'Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.' 'Lord, if it's you,' Peter replied, 'tell me to come to you on the water.' 'Come,' he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, 'Lord, save me!' Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. 'You of little faith,' he said, 'why did you doubt?'",
