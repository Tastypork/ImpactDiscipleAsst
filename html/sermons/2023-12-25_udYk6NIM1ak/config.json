    "summaryText": "Wow, what an incredible Christmas Eve message from Pastor Travis Hearn about stepping out of darkness and coming home to Jesus! Pastor Travis delivered a powerful sermon reminding us that Jesus is the True Light that can illuminate our lives and rescue us from confusion, isolation, and potential destruction. He masterfully used real-life illustrations, like his personal story of getting a DUI that ultimately led him to Christ, to demonstrate how God's light can transform our darkest moments. The message wasn't just about acknowledging darkness, but about actively choosing to step into the light of Jesus Christ. Pastor Travis challenged listeners to recognize the 'fake lights' in their lives - relationships, addictions, and worldly distractions - and instead turn to the genuine, life-changing light of Christ. His passionate plea was simple yet profound: 'Come home, it's getting dark out there.' Through personal storytelling and biblical references, he painted a vivid picture of how sin can slowly pull us away, like waves pulling a swimmer out to sea, but God's love is always ready to rescue us.",

Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full of greed. That, however, is not the way of life you learned when you heard about Christ and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness."
