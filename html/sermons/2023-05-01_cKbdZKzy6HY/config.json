    "summaryText": "Wow, what a powerful message delivered by Pastor Travis Hearn (PT) about putting God first in every area of our lives! In this sermon titled 'First Things First', PT challenges us to examine whether we're truly following Jesus or just wanting Jesus to follow our plans. Drawing from Luke 9, he passionately unpacks how many Christians say they'll follow Jesus, but always have a 'but' attached - 'I'll follow you, BUT...' Using humor and real-life illustrations, PT breaks down how we can practically prioritize God in three key areas: our schedule, our finances, and our relationships. Can you imagine how transformative our lives would be if we truly put God first in everything? The sermon is a wake-up call, reminding us that being a Christian isn't just an identity, but a radical commitment to following Jesus without excuses. From discussing the importance of keeping the Sabbath to challenging our approach to tithing, PT delivers a message that's both convicting and inspiring. His message isn't about making us feel guilty, but about helping us experience the fullness of life when we make God our true priority.",
